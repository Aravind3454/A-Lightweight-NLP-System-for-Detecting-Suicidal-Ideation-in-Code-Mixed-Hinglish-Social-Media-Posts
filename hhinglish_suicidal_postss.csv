1,delhi,Thinking about quitting ,Mental Health,"21 years old boy, from middle class family 
Family introduction 
1. dad :- high paying job but in 50lakhs debt and smokes 15 joints a day and drinks on every FSS
2. Mom:- talks with her side of family 24/7 and scrolls youtube restlessly 
3. Sister:- her whole life is only instagram, has tons of friends, lives a fake online life , she did her 12th in 2022 and from last two years doing nothing and has a boyfriend who entered her life 4 months ago 
4. My two dogs whom i love the most 

I completed my 12th in 2022 doing a regular base degree from DU and started trading this year 
I am a very ambitious guy but i am a depressed soul 
I have dreamed of giving my family a very good life and give them everything 
So started trading in 2023 with 1 lakhs which i have saved up and quickly lost it to Market and realised that i will have to learn the market first so invested around 1 lakh in learning only which i arranged by selling my gym stuff and my 3 bycycle and my spare graphics card 
In 2024 i equipped myself with the skills and came back to market with 3 lakhs which i took on loan from papa 
I was following everything which I learnt but in 4 months i lost the money and i got so badly beaten by dad 
But i thought to not quit as one day i will be successful in market so i took loan from a local guy on high intrest and this time i joined a professional guy love sharma who is sebi registed anylist and i paid for his subscription and started live trading with him also applying my own learnings but this love sharma guy is a fucking douche bag he doesn't follow any concept and give random trades and in 3 months i lost the loan amount then i invested my last bit of money to learn more about stock market and also to revise everything like price action , smc , liquidity i mean every concept and lastly took another loan from my nana who is also very rich but he is an asshole for some reasons he gave me 5 lakh loan but on 30% intrest and i thought that somehow i will pay but again same shit 
Now my daily life is almost finished i have a girlfriend of 7 years but my family hates her just cause of she is from a lower caste and they give me taunts daily ki sale chamar se shadi karega bc you are living in delhi and still fucking orthodox thinking 
Now daily from morning to evening taunts taunts and taunts only and comparison with whoever is successful 
My sisters new boyfriend is very well accepted in my house as he earns good money and my mom is always praising him and let my sister go out with him alone ab kaha gaya tumhara orthodox soch bhai why apply on me only
I am highly depressed and thinking about quitting but then i think that i have a loan of 9 lakhs which i have to repay and my parents will get burdened so stuck in this situation of dilemma that why should i care lets die or lets hold on for some more 
Other guys of my age are so fucking happy with no care of anything in the world and one more thing i had no friends in school nor in college no social connection

13,delhi,I hate my mother so much,,"My Mom wants to go to Allahabad for mahakhumb and our relatives live there(never went to their place). But I didn't wanted to go, at first I was like yeah it happens one in 144 years but what's good about that. Just because it's a rare event, doesn't make it a must attend. I don't mean to offend any religious person here. Secondly, It's gonna be super crowdy, and I would suffocate when I would see that massive crowd. To sum it all up, It's not something I would enjoy but I was ready to go for my mom, So 29th Jan is the main date, I read online to avoid going on that date as it would be super crowdy, So I suggested not to go on that date but she was firmly determined to go.

I gave tuitions in my village, so my two students(siblings) had two months fee pending. I usually ask them for fee when I need it or after 2-3 months completion and I was planning to buy something good for myself with this time payment but my mother asked me to give her the money for this trip, I was ok and I asked them telling them everything, firstly she gave half fee (they made a huge purchase recently so they are short on money) but later she returned with the other half saying that since you are going on this trip, I managed this money somehow. I teach 2 hours daily but today I taught 4 hours because I am gonna take a lot of leaves plus I have 4 small kids so gave them homework in their copies for 6 days, take 13 pages per student. 

And now my Pujya Mama ji called and gave my mom this gyan that don't go, it would be too crowded, so she is not going anymore, now she is saying leave it we will go later. Like seriously wtf??? 

I have been telling you the same thing and fighting with you all alonge but you were so firm that you want to go and take me too & Now when I've done so much from my part. Now you don't want to go????

19,delhi,Need legit recommendations on the best Psychiatrist/ Neuropsychiatrist,Mental Health,"I'm actually going through one of the worst phases of my life atm. Graduated from IP University with a btech degree in EEE and hoped to move abroad once I finished it. My dreams were shattered by Covid. Also lost my grandpa in 2020 to colon cancer, the person I loved the most in my life since I don't get along with my parents that much. We sleep all in 3 different rooms - mother,father and me and we don't enjoy a healthy family relationship at all. Fast fwd from this phase, after going through a period of crippling mental issues and being unemployed for practically 3 yrs, I've finally got a job in finance where I'm currently making 30k per month. I've consulted atleast 2 doctors to resolve my issue of mental health,my dillusions, my extreme and I do mean extreme masturbation addiction and they've provided me with meds which to a certain degree have helped but my progress has stalled even after meds changing and I'm somewhat dissatisfied with their level of service and professionalism for my condition. I've also tried therapy but didn't really work for me even after going for sessions for atleast 4  months. 

Now, for the current situation, I feel like an unmotivated loser in my life. Most of friends have moved abroad to us,uk or grabbed atleast 12-15 LPA packages in mumbai,bangalore,ncr etc. I do not have the motivation to better myself in life. I know what I have to do. I know I have to study hard since for long I've been thinking about getting an mba abroad since my dreams of MS were already shattered and now it only makes sense to go for mba in a couple of years. I know to build an impressove resume and better myself economically, I have to learn skills and apply for jobs in IB firms but I'm not doing any of it. I'm just wasting my time with no desire to better myself economically or socially. On top of that, I've become extremely dillusional thinking that I'm gonna be a multi billionaire etc etc. My mind is fucked up with no memory retention, extreme insomnia,biploar mood swings and no social confidence to carry a conversation, which is a risk contrast from what I was in my college which was a great public speaker and communicator.

I desperately need the best psychiatric help to bring my life back on track. Whenever I try to search for doctors online, it seems like the reviews are somewhat doctored or premeditated since the first 2 doctors I consulted was through their google ratings but it's been 3 years and I'm not out of this pathetic medical situation at all...


I desperately need the help of you guys to provide me with best psychiatrist that are out there and I know using the term best is childish because whoever treats you the best will be the best for you.

I feel really sad and most of my days are just filled with sadness and lethargy. 
I have been on a self hatred bout for almost a decade, so much so that I feel suicidal whenever I see my pictures, I have stopped taking pictures with family for like almost a decade as well, I can't even feel good about myself whenever i go outside, I feel like people are judging me or laughing at me, I tried everything to change my perception of self, but it just never works. I have tried weight loss and skin care and everything but it never works, instead I started balding at 21 and that ruined my confidence even more, have been taking minoxidil and fin for a year now and still haven't seen any change, hairline just keeps getting worse, it triggers my dysmporhia and dysphoria both. 
I have never really had any healthy connection with people and mostly I feel like an alien, I don't have any irl friend either. 
Right now I came back from book fair with my family, and I just started feeling sad and suicidal and cried for like an hour. 
I have been taking therapy, but she herself has said I need to get meds cause I have some body dysmporhia and obsessive thoughts. 
I feel like I have restricted myself so much cause of judgement and fear, that I just feel good when I am at home doing nothing, I just wanna fix my life, I am 23 and stuck at a masters course I don't like, I am tired of constantly comparing myself to everyone and feel bad, sometimes I just wanna jump down  the metro track.
I really have no talents, I look sub par(no matter what I try), I have no friends, I don't even feel good enough to express myself the way I want to, I just feel super stuck and I really want to break out. 
I am thinking of dying so I can be free right now. 
I really feel like I can never have the kind of stuff I want cause no matter what I do it will never be enough, please I wanna get out of this stuff. 
Is there a way to get free help? My therapist already cost me too much and I have no job as I am studying, so I can't finance more.

I've recently finished my board exams (I don't know what my results will be since I wasn’t serious in 10th. In 9th, I studied for 4 hours daily to improve, but my efforts didn’t yield the expected results).

It's been 10 days since my boards ended, and I'm trying to start my 11th-grade studies so I can keep up with my coaching classes in the future and minimize the chances of backlogs. I’m not sure why, but I feel that my PCM concepts from 9th and 10th are quite clear.

Q1) Should I start my JEE preparation now, or should I enjoy my vacation since I won’t get this free time again for the next two years?

Q2) Should I uninstall all my games like Valorant and Clash of Clans, along with Instagram, or is it okay to play occasionally to relieve stress?

Q3) I know for sure that my school friend circle consisted of goons of the school, and they were a bad influence on me. Should I cut off all interaction with them for the next two years?

51,delhi,A little too lonely in my life,Mental Health,"So when I graduated from my high school that is after 12th, I got admission in an university which is not very famous and not very repeated, but it is what you call a 'kaam chalu' college with a campus that is not that big, but just consist of one short building, basically it's very small  
And after 12th since the pandemic had just gone over, I was kind of confident in myself and I felt confident in doing stuff. I started doing theatre. I participate in many theatre place and I started reading books journalling and doing a lot more things that boosted self-esteem.  
After this, when I joined my college, I found that no one matched my energy as much. I want to I feel like school was the perfect time where I had made those friends and now that I am in college. I'm allowed to make my own friend circle. choose my own friends, but in my college, I cannot seem to find any good friend rather it makes me feel kind of lonely when every other acquaintance is hanging out with another, I just know everyone enough to say 'hi and hello' but not at all enough to hold a conversation with them  
It may be because I have very high standards for someone being my friend. I think I'm a person who balances his studies, the competitions I want to participate in my college life my career, and my friendship. I don't want to decrease the priority of anything but I want someone that can match my abilities and has the same liking as me, but I cannot find that in college, but the problem with me is that I want to be on top of the societies part. That means I am deeply involved in many societies of my college and when I am involved, I can not seem to fit in any of the friend group there. I find it too forcing for me to pretend something that I do not like N now, I am just at the risk of being ostracised by everyone  
So once was a guy who was very confident in his self-esteem, very comfortable in a skin and did not fear to speak anything at all. Now there is this guy  who is very insecure and with low self-esteem

  
I know I should make friends outside of college. I have a girlfriend also, but something feels off to me when I'm not able to make friends at college, especially when School was such a place where friendship was so common and now coming to college where I cannot make even one good friend.  
And I am very depressed because of this, I don't know how to deal with this honestly

I honestly don't know what I want from you guys to tell me what I just wanted to let it out",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1j1522t/a_little_too_lonely_in_my_life/,0

57,Neet_india,how delusional am i?,🆘 HELP ,"iam a class 12 student aiming to crack NEET 2025 in my first attempt without coaching. I decided to work for it in April-May 2024 and have been preparing independently. so I made sure to cover Class 11 concepts thoroughly instead of cramming during my +1 vacation. In just two months, I cleared all my concepts, focusing heavily on Physics and Chemistry. For Biology, I read chapters several times and did questions too. My concepts are clear of +1, and I have a solid plan to achieve my goal.

When Class 12 started, my entire focus shifted to it, which slowed down my NEET preparation until October. From January onwards, I started getting back on track. Now, my Biology, Chemistry, and Physics syllabus for Class 12 is complete. I want to solve more questions, but I’m aware that I haven’t taken any NEET mock exams like foundation students. However, I’m confident in my concepts and eager to work harder.

My plan is to focus entirely on Class 12 until the board exams, ensuring my concepts are crystal clear. After boards, I’ll revisit Class 11, as it’s been a year since I last revised it. With only about a month left for NEET after boards, I’ll primarily focus on Class 11 while integrating Class 12 revision. I also plan to join a crash course at that time.

Is this plan realistic, or am I being delusional Should I make any changes? I’m fully committed to cracking NEET 2025 and willing to do whatever it takes. End me with brutally honest comments, i really want advice or anything that could improvise my plan, or hurt my ego idc help me.

123,delhi,How do you find right therapist/people to help?,Mental Health,"I have some problems, one with nihilist feeling since last 4-5 years and recently from last 8-9 months scepticism type. I get feeling of non existence, like nothing really exists. No you, no me etc. although I'm in control rn. Every once in a while i am getting anxiety for no real reason. I am unable to study giving me further more stress.

I cant really afford therapist, but if you know someone who deals with such problem please tell me theor name just in case I'm unable to handle it anymore. Else if you know something that i can refer to for help book, video, ideology, philosophy etc. 

I'm trying for meditation once again. I've tried previous as teen for years which i feel didn't have much benefit. I thought maybe im doing it wrong. If you know something that can help i would be greatful. 

Few things about me incase it matters: 
I have no real friends and stuff. Almost 0 female interaction, not looking for friends or gf either. Yeah sometimes get urge but goes away in a day. No interest in dying (or living both are kinda same for me). I dont get much time for anything cause preparing for upsc. I dont get much physical exercise apart from 4 km of daily walking. I wish i could but in this cold and lack of time it's difficult. I do have masterbation addiction which I'm improving. Not a huge deal imo, i take break to test myself and it's not hard. I dont get good meal cause it's very expensive out here and I'm not earning, i dont want to burden parents more. Also i barely see green vegetables made in mess food. So i cant really help even if i get food. Hopefully my diet problem will get better after few months when i cut my expenses.",9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/18pu0oj/how_do_you_find_right_therapistpeople_to_help/,0

130,delhi,Failed Artist with Losing Sanity,Mental Health,"I don’t know to how many users this post will reach (because I feel whatever I post here never gets seen), but I’d like to share this with 2.5 of you folks who might see it… 

Okay so, Hi Folks, I never wanted to write this post I felt it was of no use and no one could help me ( and because I was scared to post it because of the judgments/ trolling too ) but it’s at this point my only shot in the dark for hope…

So basically I'm an “about to be 22-year-old” person with an inclination towards creative domains, Mainly want to be an artist but with time, I don’t think this will ever become my reality because I start to hate art each day (maybe because of not working on it the right way or some other reason but I'm  just done with it) 

It's been 3 years since I moved to Delhi with my so-called remaining “family”, where I'm pursuing just a shitty diploma from a generic private insitute (because I don’t have enough brain and money to get into a college)

And for all these 3 years spent here, if I am honest, I still am fucking lonely and rotten to the core because I failed to build my life here ( mainly because of my environment and my incompetence )

My biggest fault is that I’m a “jack of all traits” and I'm not getting to even figure out more or do the things that I want to…

I tried reaching out to modeling (because others said I could do it otherwise I feel I am personally very hideous) but no luck so far…due to lack of contacts and definitely not coming from that priviledge

I tried to ask if anyone needs assistance with craftworks (like cosplayers) but then, why would anyone want a paid help when they can do it themselves and mainly , that is the whole point of cosplay (to be able to make it on your own)

And to this day, for 7 years, I am still holding back the idea to be a content creator because I don’t see myself as someone who could provide any substantial value to this world (and waise bhi we all know how saturated everything is)

But enough crying for all about it…

I am just writing this out in hopes of being heard and understood because Its heavier day by day on my chest for not being enough and not being free from the shackles (my past and my useless family) that holds me and there is not a single day where I wish either they die or me…

I am just done with being at this point..",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1fb7nky/failed_artist_with_losing_sanity/,0

136,delhi,Friendship like this sucks. Didnt expect this from Delhi friend,Mental Health,"Mod please don't delete my post...I have a friend who lives in Chd now and we both used to live in Delhi earlier. Our homes are at very close proximity to each other. We both were in same school, tution and then, we remained in contact with each other almost on daily basis till 2020

Even now, we talk usually once in a month and I realised over a period of time that he was actually a RED FLAG and was never a true friend of mine. I regret wasting my hours and hours of being with him hanging out. Here are some points which I consider worth sharing with all of you - 

1. He used me very cleverly for money whenever he went to eat out but have ample money to feed his sister and family. I thought he might not having the money so for sake of friendship I always used to trfr him the amount in a good faith but I got a shock when I knew he had the money and he used to spend his amount only on his family. It shattered my heart.

2. I have sinus so basically I have a runny nose and how the hell you can be totally dumb about this, when you spent years with a person and saw him innumerable times using tissue paper to clean nose. He never asked me about this problem and during usual talks it was me who disclosed this to him 

3. Never shares genuine feedback on where I lack and how can I improve. If your friend is not helping you to uplift, he is not a friend. Period

4. Talks to my other friends behind my back and talks all -ve things about me but won't share anything to me.

5. He believed that I cheated on him with his GF. Lacks trust basically. He is having no proof of this 

There are many other things which I can't post here otherwise it will become too long. To cut story short, he is basically a selfish person who keeps friendships for the sake of his interest. How fool was I that I kept bearing all this for such a long period of time. My grandfather was used to tell me that these friends are of no use.

So its been always a problem with me in my life that at social spaces and even by my own family ( my mother mostly ) , I get bullied just for existing (not exaggerating this, trust me)

and for everything else from how I look, act, do, think and even for having different interests and hobbies which aren't generic.


But mainly what hurts me to this day is when people mostly had constantly bullied or talked shit about how I look.

And for context, I look very girlish for a guy and I like to carry myself in a certain way that isn't the socital standards for man , and Im aware of it because I seriously don't feel the need to be a socially acceptable template for what a guy or a man should be. I am personally comfortable with myself but its just the nonsencial bullying is what hurts me ( I am a sensitive person honestly )


And recently , Im keeping a little long hair for awhile and the way I get sideeyed and get commented is now started to affect me very very deeply...Like I get it I look girlish or ""not man enough"" but like Is it that offensive that I get the treatment as if I shouldn't exist at all?!

Like literally , this has became a prominent reason why I shunned myself from socializing and connecting with people as it feels like im always in the wrong and Im really really tired of feeling this way.

I constantly ask myself what have I done to deserve all of this and why im not fortunate enough to have a safe space where I could just be myself in peace , It feels as if I should just disappear totally ( But im just such a wimp I didn't even attempted it cuz I overthink about the aftermath or the mess I will leave after death)

200,JEE,Fucked Up!!!,Serious,"



Hello, a 17M and a jee aspirant this side. So i have been preparing for the mains from past 2 years and going to give my second attempt (Jan attempt went too bad although I didn't studied that hard). During this 2 years I got into a relationship with a girl, she was my 10th classmate and used to sit beside me. I never in my life thought I would date her. But in June 2024 she confessed me, first I didn't want a relationship (actually I wanted) but somehow I agreed to this. Before this shit happened we were Best friends. She was too caring and obviously the most cutest girl I have ever meet. I got attached to her so hard that I can't even say. She knew that I am going to give Mains, Jan attempt went not too good soi so I shifted my focus for the april attempt. 
I was at my lowest due to some reasons (she knew that) but decided to give me a final hit before the second attempt.
 
I have my exam on the 8th but I am not being able to concentrate on studies and constantly being distracted about her thoughts. Why tf it is so hard to move on ?????? Give me some advice to what to study and how to study now. Your advice is most admired, help me out to get through this. And thankyou for reading till the end.

I'm 19f, I've been preparing for jee, did in 11th-12th got 93 percentile, took a drop and started preparing on my own. I don't come from a well to do family and yes I'm general. Plus there are many issues happening at home, it's kind of really toxic and I knew what was I falling into while I decided of taking a drop. I thought I could manage but no. After Jan attempt (got 95) I decided that I can't study here anymore. I don't even have a room or study table or corner of my own. So I started looking for libraries here in my city. Now I've always been nerdy, shy and timid type of person. A guy commented he could help and he passed me library's number. The conversation should have stopped there but he started initiating conversations and we were actually similar in a lot of sense. Our interests collided, though he's from commerce but he likes to study about science. He was being really nice in the start and I might have got attached and then..he started changing. He started pulling away....he wouldn't reply to texts or text from his side. Now I feel so shit... everyday I wake up in anxiety. Can't sleep. And I feel shit because all my life I never felt like this, I've always been anti romantic kind of person..but now this... it's just making me feel so bad. Bad because I feel like a total useless piece of shit to even feel like this when my exam is near. How pitiful and useless I've become.

But things changed when I moved to my uncle's house for higher studies. My grades started slipping, my social skills deteriorated, and I just feel stuck. My aunt's OCD doesn't help, as it creates a stressful environment.

Here's the thing: when I'm outside, I'm fine. I can put on a mask and pretend everything's okay. But when I'm alone, the sadness kicks in, and I just can't seem to do anything except rot on my bed.

I've had blood tests done to check my vitamin levels, and they're all fine. I sleep well, too. But despite all this, I just can't seem to shake off this feeling of sadness and lethargy.

My exams are going on, but I'm struggling to study even for 10 minutes without feeling sad or distracted. I feel like I'm losing myself, and I don't know what's wrong with me.

235,delhi,I did terrible in college,Mental Health,"So, I have wanted to post about my situation for a very long time, but have been holding back I suppose.

I did a BSc. degree in Mathematics (Hons) and it was incredibly hard. I loved math and went into it thinking it'd be like practical mathematics, but it turned out to be completely theoretical and anyone who studies pure math will tell you, it's like inventing a new language. If anyone likes highschool math, they should be going for an engineering degree and not a math degree.

I was academically a great student in school, but not a good student in college. I studied in a pretty decent college from DU, and it was honestly a **nightmare.** I am not saying DU isn't good, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone going for sciences.

I'd travel 3 hrs front and back to college, classes would randomly get cancelled, (sometimes all of them) and you'd be roaming idly in college after travelling so far.

ALL our professors were incredibly bitter and often nosey- this was something exclusive to the math department for some reason. I have allergy issues and I'd get sick often, and that'd mean staying at home, since the college is 1.5 hrs away by metro. This would mean absences, while attendance wasn't an issue, professors only ever assumed the worst of you, despite what you tell them. They won't help you if ask them for extra guidance nearing exams, if you ask them doubts they might even laugh at you and say you don't attend classes/you don't even know the basics, some of them straight up never provided solutions cause we were supposed to ""think them up"" and if you were able to remember half an answer on an exam, they'd cut the entire mark and if you go upto them, they'd accuse you of cheating. They wouldn't like it if you solved a question by an alternate method, and if you told them some other teacher taught you the method, they'd tell you the teacher doesn't know anything. They would also often self-insert themselves in your position and would constantly say that they were better than us when they were at our age.

The professors were also incredibly nosey and bitter, luckily I was never involved in this since my life was uneventful, but they often gossiped about students and would get over-involved in their lives. The fucked part is despite all this moral policing, one of them had an affair with one of our classmates, and a female professor, defended one of the faculty members, calling him ""like her son"" while he was sexually harassing one of my classmates through text. One of the professors, himself suggested for us to not go into academia, especially in this field, because he recalled his early life where older professors would mock him, disregard his research and even steal it. This pretty much disillusioned me from ever going for a master's in math.

I joined a few societies, one of them was a math one, which all of us thought would be related to math, but it was basically a party planning committee for math dept things, which was incredibly toxic due to aforementioned professors, and competitive students. I wish I left it. I wish I took a PG near college, but I just wasn't thinking clearly since I felt like I am used to travelling.

I myself didn't have my priorities right and this is all my fault really. I think I assumed I'd end up doing a Phd in Math before college, but upon being there I realised I just don't have the knack for it. Tbvh tho barely any of my classmates had a knack for math either, but most of them went for masters, because they ""feel proud when people tell them they're studying such a tough subject"".

But my classmates were far ahead, doing acturial courses simultaneously, multiple internships, and had planned way ahead for their master's. Since math is not a technical or applied degree, very few people got a job. The funny thing is I didn't party, didn't drink, smoke, do drugs or even attend any college fests, but I was still struggling with my grades. I didn't sit for placement because I had backlogs in a subject. I don't know what was wrong with me, but I think I was so anxious for some reason that I was constantly just distracting myself from real life, through procrastination. I was also boy-crazy, which is funny cause I wasn't actively talking to any guy, I had a 1 very shitty encounter and since then I had many of those, through male friends who I hadn't even approached in anyway. I wasn't even on any dating apps. But it all caused me to self-pity and wallow in my head, I really wish I could have avoided that. But these are all things that I did to myself and no one else is responsible for. I'm somewhat disillusioned by romantic love too, because it feels so manipulative, impractical and impermanent, especially at this age.

My parents are very supportive but they're handful sometimes. When I was in college and planning to take a gap year, I asked my father to help me with making a list of colleges, bless his soul, he tried but he isn't the most practical person and started thinking out of the box and found 3-4 unrelated courses, and abandoned his search eventually. This usually just leads to my mom blaming him for being unhelpful, and such blame games in itself don't really help. I guess since I was a good student throughout school (didn't even have a phone until after 12th), and a younger sibling, some things just never even occurred to me. I feel like my abilities left me when I truly needed them.

I have currently taken a gap year and I was thinking of doing an MSc in Data science or statistics. I gave the IIT JAM too and it didn't go so well, it's like I have lost my abilities to focus. Although I'm genuinely trying to improve and give other exams. I just feel a bit unequipped for the real world, altho I do feel better these days, I'm trying to improve, I'm trying to use my anxiety to help myself out rather than going against myself.

Sorry for the long rant, I just wanted to get this off my chest and hope people will learn from my mistakes. I would also welcome any advice people might be willing to provide me.",1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1jh2rwr/i_did_terrible_in_college/,0

244,Neet_india,Motivation,🆘 HELP ,"Hey. 2026 tard.

I completed 11th in Jan. Throughout 11th my marks and ranks were amazing, very consistent. I would place top 20/800 on average and score 650+.

Recently I've been feeling very burnt out. For the past 7 weeks, my average dropped to 620. My ranks have dropped to 50-100 each test.



3 weeks ago we had our final NEET cumulative test for 11th (30 percent syllabus) with which, immediately our school started 12th. No break no relax.

Since then, we've had 2 weekend tests and 3rd this sat.

Week test 1- 646/720, rank 46/800.

I didn't want to study, didn't study either. I revised in school and enjoyed at home. I told my mom I wasn't gonna study that week and slept well.


Week 2- 621/720, rank 60/800.

I didn't feel like studying at all, even the days I wanted to study I slept. 9 hours a day average.


Week 3- Not gonna cross 600

This week I've been wanting to study but I can't. If I wake up late, i sleep with the book in my hands.

If I try to wake up early, I end up turning off the alarm and sleeping.


I've been facing the issue of being burnt out for the past 7-8 weeks. My ranks dropped very drastically. I couldn't score well.

But now I'm even unable to study. I'm scared my neet prep will be fucked if this continues. I can't even focus on what I'm doing. How do I come out of this? 


Anyone who's been through this shit please me man.",2,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Neet_india/comments/1j4zof4/motivation/,0

I'm feeling quite lost as I'm only beginning to prep for the NEET exam now. I really want to achieve a good score, but I don’t have much time to study, and my foundation is weak (I haven't learned most of the syllabus I've seen for all the subjects).

Honestly, I’m not sure how to start my preparation or what to focus on. 

I've heard that NCERT books are important, but I’m confused about which specific ones I should use since I get so many different results when I search online.

Professionals with over a decade of experience are left wandering, struggling to find jobs in a system that seems to have forgotten them. The allure of lavish lifestyles crumbles when you realize it’s all a façade, hiding silent suffering and unspoken battles. Beneath the city’s glimmering surface lies a world of broken relationships, unaddressed struggles, and lonely hearts. It’s heartbreaking to see how far we’ve come, only to feel further apart. What is this progress worth if it’s leaving so many behind, silently drowning in the chaos? Where is this path leading us?

271,JEE,My IIT-JEE preparation journey!,Serious,"I FAILED !!!

And I failed miserably.

(I will try to keep it as short as possible)
It all started back in 2K18 when I, like many other students, packed my bags to Kota after getting good marks in class 10th board examinations. And guess what few days after I was in a whole different city thousands of kilometres away from my home, with no friends, no smartphone nothing just standing alone. I got myself into one of the renowned coaching institutes and started with my JEE preparations. To be honest, the first few weeks were just so difficult for me first time living so far from my family and in a completely different environment, you can see through the eyes of the aspirants how dedicated there are to the exam and what it meant to them, it makes you both motivated and scared at the same time.


Coming back to the journey first few months went very smooth, I was getting good marks in my exams and also managed to retain a decent batch. Things started getting worse the day I started taking my studies lightly not doing proper revision, not completing sheets and DPPs on time and starting missing out classes, for a few days I thought I would manage it later on, but trust me guys with the pace teachers in Kota teach its tough to cover your backlogs especially if you are behind in chapters like RBD and SHM or I can say mechanics (yes I was weak in physics). As a result of that my marks started to decline like a block on a frictionless inclined plane and I also got demoted to a lower batch. Slowly I started losing my confidence seeing people who were once far behind me now doing so well and I on the other side don't even know what to do. I then refocused myself and started working hard but this time with a lot of stress and self-doubt as one year of my preparation was on the verge of completion and I can't see myself getting into any of the IITs, that phase of shifting from class 11th to 12th was really very depressing, I didn’t go home during my holidays and studied like hell just stayed in my room for 10 days straight and covered maximum of my backlogs.

I fear a lot, and I overthink a lot these were the main things which let me down in my journey, have confidence my friends believe in yourself first of all and listen to your teachers never underestimate them do what they say and stay consistent you will definitely get selected in your dream college.

When I reached class 12th I almost lost the motive and interest of cracking JEE. It was the first time when I started thinking what I will do if I dont get selected in IIT . Things just don’t go the way I wanted to, from there and just after few months when the BIG Day came I failed !!!! All my dreams just shattered in front of my eyes and I was just feeling lost. I turned to my dad and said ‘Sorry papa nahi hua merese’ . What he said in return I still remember very well. He said ‘ Beta maine apna 100% diya tujhe padhane me isliye mujhe kisi baat ka regret nahi haii , agar tune bhi apna 100% diya hai to regret mat rkh kisi baat ka IIT nahi hua to or kuch aacha hoga’. After hearing him I can’t explain in words how disappointing I was feeling, all the aspirants can relate here. We all know more than us its our parents who wants to see us doing well in life. Half of us only prepare for this exam because our parents wants to see us studying in IIT, its more kind of their dream to see their son/daughter in IIT.

At last I would just say this exam is not about how smart you are, if you work consistently hard for 2 years no matter if you are average in studies, you can crack it !! And believe me it’s all worth it, every minute you put for this exam its all worth it.

So work hards fulfill your dreams and make your parents proud !!!

All the best !!!",190,38,https://i.redd.it/ukko2g9c3jre1.jpeg,0
272,delhi,How do you know when you love someone?,Mental Health,"



WARNING: LONG


Hello people we met during the start of college and we immediately hit it off. We got really close and got doubts whether we had feelings for each other. We took some time to evaluate this and she said she does have feelings but due to family dynamics she can't commit and I was not confident in my feelings so I said I could not commit too.

Months passed of we still being close (as friends) and we both felt like we were developing more feelings again. I wanted to wait and really confirm it with myself regarding how I feel before discussing it but a situation came between us where I had to say it prematurely. One thing led to another and without solving these issues and assessing one's feelings towards each other we engaged in sexual acts with each other though purely over calls and text. We both were feeling guilty of this fact that without actually commiting (feelings of doubt over this person and for her, doubts whether this will work out long term) we are doing this and stuff but we still kept doing it regularly. Many fights and stuff broke out during this period where I was accused of using her for pleasure and stuff. All this put a huge mental toll on both of us and unfortunately I wasn't able to cope up with my studies which led to me having multiple backlogs. Once when we were being close in a public place, it led to an authority finding us out and they threatened to call our parents which really shook us both up.

Everything changed after that event where she became scared of being alone with me at all and all talks regarding relationship etc was out of the table. I felt responsible and guilty for whatever happened and I was by her side trying to be there as a support and a person to confide in. This period was the hardest as it was a period I felt like I was in a relationship with her one sided. I would have these thoughts and wanting to be with her and stuff but she was emotionally unavailable due to that event. I didn't know what I felt emotionally but still wanted to be by her for as long as possible (I knew forever was a stretch considering her family). This period of me showing more affection (I don't wanna get into the details but I went above and beyond and basically was her boyfriend except the sexual stuff) in general lasted around 1.3 years during which I gradually started to realise that she won't come back and this won't really work out. 

One day she opened the talks again after speaking with some people regarding this but still we were unsure (me because of this extended period of one sided affection which made me feel I won't be valued by her and she because of family dynamics). Things had gotten slightly better since then but we still are in this confusion. We both do relationship things with each other (emotionally but nothing sexual maybe apart from making 18+ jokes and holding hands alone) but still this question of whether to commit or not looms us both. Now the thing is we care about each other a lot and have invested a lot emotionally. I feel hesitant to say ""I love you"" and commit to a relationship because: I feel like she has a different mindset about dating and relationships ( she wanted everything to be serious as in till marriage but she is extremely confused about all this), different ideals I'm an atheist and she's a devote follower of Hindu gods, feeling like she won't reciprocate sexually, and lastly I kind of feel like deep down I lost out in the career of my life because of her. ( I am trying to actively come out of this feeling because it's not healthy and I know it's not true entirely because she didn't ask me to not study and be depressed, I did it to myself because I couldn't handle these overwhelming feelings. But I can't help but feel this way when I see her and all my friend being placed in well paying jobs while I'm still having multiple backlogs literally unsure of what to do in life. It doesn't help that I pleaded her for help in studies and she couldn't teach or help because of her strict household which kind of makes me feel really bad). She doesn't say ""I love you"" to me because her parents are strict and conservative and she is unsure whether our love can win at the end. Her parents health isn't good and they may use their health conditions as a bargaining chip to make her marry within caste.

I have simplified everything that has happened in the last 4 years as there are much more nuances in everything that I have mentioned but on a surface level this is my situation. 

What do I do?

TL;DR: Started as close friends in college, developed feelings but couldn't commit due to family dynamics. Engaged in a complicated, guilt-ridden relationship involving sexual acts over calls and texts. Got caught in public, faced academic challenges, and her fear led to emotional distance. Despite one-sided affection for 1.3 years, talks about commitment resumed. Confusion persists due to differences in mindset, religion, and career struggles. Hesitation to commit due to perceived career loss, differing values, and uncertain future with her conservative family. Seeking advice on what to do.

294,delhi,I used to be one of the smart kids but now have become a complete shadow of my former self,Mental Health,"As a kid I was one of the teacher's favourites. I wasn't exactly popular but known in class for my grades. I used to draw and play the keyboard, was a voracious reader, filmbuff and gamer, had great friends and was loved by my family members as well. They used to think I'm ""special"" or something lol. But slowly as I grew up I started losing interest in most things. Especially in my teens, I started getting moodier. I started spending most of my time away from other people, reading books, watching movies and overthinking every single goddamn thing. My grades started dipping as well. I didn't find studies tough (still haven't tbh) but I started losing interest in academics. I wouldn't say I was very extroverted in my childhood but I definitely was more fun-loving. Still my teens weren't bad, I had fun with my school friends and made some nice memories.

The real trouble started in 9-10th, when I got shockingly low marks. I just couldn't concentrate on my studies and spent hours daydreaming. However I made up for everything by getting a good percentage in my boards. But the real downfall came right afterwards, when I barely passed my 11th standard. And the worst part is that I really couldn't care lesser about those marks. In 12th there was covid, so we were given marks on our boards on the basis of our 10th marks. I was confused, dropped a year, gave engineering entrance exams and came to a private university. However I screwed up those exams too, and got in just by luck.

1st year was a complete screw up, I got awful grades and multiple backlogs and today I got caught cheating in my 2nd year end semesters exams. And like I said, I really am not able to care about all this in any way. I'm not studying at all, but I'm not enjoying my life either. I see people fooling around with their friend groups, going on dates, getting wasted and still acing exams. But I'm doing literally nothing. I am an introvert and have always felt like a misfit, but now I'm so detached from everything that I genuinely don't care if this place gets shut down or something. Plus it's full of smart kids from affluent places so I have the added pressure of competing with them.

As a child I was one of those so-called ""sincere, obedient, good boys"" but now I don't give a damn about anything. I talk like a guy with no filters (almost in a rude, obnoxious way), don't have any friend groups, no girlfriend (inferiority complex, poor, socially awkward). I tried joining clubs and sports but I kinda lost interest in them after a while as well. I always seem to be distracted and confused and anxious. I suspect I might have ADHD or some other shit. I used to write and sketch and be genuinely interested in multiple things, but now I just while away time thinking about my childhood, my friends and my family members. I don't even like most people in my university, even though there's nothing wrong with them. Not just them, I don't like most people of my generation either. I loathe social media, I feel the world was a much better place without it. I feel lonely and lost and directionless all the time. I'm just existing, not living. I overthink and procrastinate every single moment, and I don't even care. In fact, today when I got caught I actually felt relieved. Even cheating felt bothersome.

Every time I try to improve or something, I go right back to square one. I've left so many books half-read. I want to consume educational and scientific and philosophical content but I get overwhelmed by all of them. I have this thing where something that I want to do or have to do it=s right in front of me but I'm paralysed. The kid version of me would've been so ashamed of the present me. Everyone in my friends and family thought (and still think) that I'm gonna do something, become something. I feel like such a fraud when I face them (funnily. this feeling was there even when I topped back then, the feeling of being an imposter). I wonder what my parents are gonna think of me when they get to know everything I've done. (cheating, failing exams, getting high and drunk and shit like that multiple times; I didn't enjoy any of that though, nothing beats spending time with your loved ones). Tbh even they can sense how much I have changed but they have no idea what to do about this. You know those ""literally me"" characters from movies about lonely weirdos? Well they're literally me.

295,delhi,Friend brutally beaten up by Local,Mental Health,"My acquaintance, let's call him X from UP is preparing for Neet Examination, joined library in Delhi NCR(Gurgaon). He comes from humble background and he teaches tution to afford his expenses.

There were some issues between him and another Y, proud Jat of Haryana related to the AC remote, on who will keep the remote in library and that escalated to a level both were not on good terms.

 Y was frustrated how can someone from outside coming to his state, could talk to him like this. This thing he had shared with others and that he will teach a lesson to X one day.
Today Y called his 4-5 friends and they beat X badly, he started b***ding from head. Y left with his friends. CCTV recording is there, but Police is involved hence you know.

X called the police and Police took X to P.S and Y's father alongwith others were there and Police did the compromise between both of them. 
""Y just had to say sorry and he will never do such things in future.""
X had to even get medical treatment at his own expenses..

It's painful to see, Might is Right has become the rule in this nation. You can't expect justice if you're not well connected. This explains why millionaires or people can afford moving out to other developed nations are leaving this place. You're just a pawn, you'll be used, exploited without any accountability.

Good thing is X has accepted his fate and hopefully he will give the upcoming examination with same zeal.

Lord is the only Saviour for people who are financially or politically weak.🙏

320,delhi,My Battle with Anxiety. Need help.,Mental Health,"I am a final year student. My hands tremor badly, and it’s been like this since time immemorial. I also struggle with collecting my thoughts and expressing them in an articulate manner. It's only been a couple of years since I started noticing that I have panic attacks as well. A few months ago, I started seeing a doctor, and he recommended some tests. All my tests came back normal. I discussed my symptoms with him, and he diagnosed me with GAD. He prescribed medication to me, but truth be told, I was unable to afford it. So, after a month, I stopped taking my medication.

Condition wise I was feeling a bit better for quite some time, but then I noticed my tremors were getting worse. To give you some perspective, I cannot hold a spoon and eat rice without dropping half of it. People around me have also started noticing this. It was noticeable before, but only a handful of people pointed this out to me. Now, every person I meet asks me why my hands are shaking involuntarily.

A fortnight ago, I noticed that my legs had started to shake as well. It's not as severe as my hands, but it is noticeable to me. I have had thoughts about ending my life before, and they persisted for months, if not years. I was never clinically diagnosed with depression, so I can't say anything about that. Fast forward to a couple of days ago when I was with my friends in a car, enjoying music and dancing. It was 3 in the morning when suddenly, out of the blue, my chest started pounding rapidly. I couldn't breathe, and my vision became blurry. It was like I was experiencing a blackout. I couldn't comprehend what was happening. I asked my friend to pull over, and as soon as I got out of the car, I fell onto the road. I was shaking severely, and the only thought I had was to go to the middle of the road and get myself hit by a vehicle. Fortunately, my body didn’t support me, and I couldn't get up for the next 15 minutes. I have had panic attacks before, but I have never experienced something like this. I wasn't crying. Yes, there were tears, but I will not consider that crying.

I have never revealed anything about my condition to my parents, nor do I plan to do so. I need help, but I don’t want to be a burden. I have never disclosed all of this to anyone, and I definitely don’t want to share this with my friends. Yes, they are nice people, but I will not consider divulging anything personal to them. They give terrible advice that is of no help. I am a teetotaller, I have never smoked, and I have never been in a relationship.

328,JEE,ICSE Student Moving to Class 11 – Should I Choose Online or Offline Coaching for JEE? Need Guidance!,Serious,"Hello everyone,

I’m currently in Kanpur and moving to Class 11 in the ICSE board. I have studied in ICSE since Class 1 and will continue in ICSE till Class 12. However, I have no idea about JEE preparation—how to start, what books to follow, or how to approach the syllabus.

One of my biggest dilemmas is whether to opt for offline or online coaching. I’ll be attending a regular school, not a dummy school, and for the first few months, I plan to go to school 3-4 days a week, eventually reducing it to 2 days a week by mid-semester. Additionally, I might also take 1-hour English coaching for fluency in speaking and writing.

If I choose offline coaching, I have to factor in a 1-hour travel time daily. I have heard many negative reviews about offline coaching centers in Kanpur—complaints about frequent teacher changes, syllabus delays, and overcrowded batches. I also do not want to go to Kakadeo due to the rush.

Another concern is batch size. I struggle to focus in a class with more than 20 students because even minor disturbances break my flow. I don’t mean to sound picky or unreasonable—I'm just stating what I personally find difficult to adjust to. If anyone knows of good, less crowded offline coaching centers in Kanpur that ensure syllabus completion on time, please recommend them.

For online coaching, I am considering Competishun or Allen Distance Learning  but I am open to other suggestions. If I go for online coaching, how do I ensure I stay on track and get the right mentorship? Also, I’ve heard that coaching study material is very important—how much should I rely on it compared to other books?

Another concern is my memory. I am good at understanding concepts, but I tend to forget things quickly. This worries me, especially for Chemistry, since many say it requires a lot of memorization. Any tips to overcome this?

I also have no financial constraints, so cost is not an issue. However, my eyesight is very weak (-8.0 myopic), so if screen time is a major concern in online coaching, I’d like to know how to manage it.

Lastly, I know nothing about NCERT books. Since ICSE doesn’t follow them, should I still refer to them for JEE preparation? And if so, how should I integrate them into my study plan?

I have a good set of teachers at school who might be able to help with some concepts, but I still need structured coaching. If anyone could recommend the best modules, books, or study materials, I’d greatly appreciate it.

If you have any general advice for JEE preparation, even if it’s unrelated to my concerns, please share! Any insights are highly appreciated.

Looking forward to your responses.

Out-off total attending days for my coaching i have attended only 60% of them with most of the time after coaching I got burnouts and did not study. I somehow pushed through 12th and gave my 1st attempt in which I got 51%ile. Through 12th I stopped working out and gained around 19kg of weight. I was lean and now I am fat. People who have not met me for a couple years see me and first thing they say that I've gotten lazy and gained weight. Weight gain was a clear side effect of increased cortisol. Now I am here , I don't think I will be able to do good in entrance exams based on my current study. I cannot sleep and if i do i wake up with headache and body ache which kills whatever motive and decision I had to study. I am still stressed and unhealthy and still get sick due to simplest things. I sought help with my seniors and some older friends and was recommended a drop. Drop looks really attractive right now, at least to me because I need to get my life back, get into a schedule and balance myself. This comes with a risk. My parents are doctors who said drop will help you somewhat but is it really worth a yearlong extension of already stressed-out state of mine? And all this just to get into IIT.

I wanted to be a psychologist. I'm doing mba rn. Be it what stream I select, what college I go to or what mode of study I opt for (take a guess? That's right. I'm doing online university) it has all been decided by my parents. 

My friends? I just call random people I meet online, my friends. Ngl, 2020 was when I was in 12th grade and the lockdown started, and you can say I'm still in that same lockdown. 

No cap shawty, I literally leave my house like once in 5-6 months. That too always with my sister or parents. And agar i get the chance to go out with my friend (not friends kyuki ek hi bachi hai) toh bawaal ho jaata hai. 

I honestly, just want advice on how to fix this. Like, bhai mein 21 ki hu and i feel like I'm straying further and further away from people of my age group. 

Should I just say ""aight I'm going to start stepping out now"" 
Cuz even if I do that, where do I even go!? Dost hi ek hai aur woh bhi busy > :((

Because if only the students who have exam on 2nd are rescheduled then does that mean the other students giving paper on 2nd have less competetion because percentile is calculated based on the paper we wrote 

Suppose now assume of one lakh students are rescheduled out of 5 lakh writing then the people writing exam on 2nd will be only 4lakh so basically less competetion but then wont the rescheduled Exam only have 1lakh people so won't they have even more less competetion so how will it be fair for the people. Also it's not like nta can just give us percentile by including the people who got rescheduled paper with the people who writing on 2nd cause then it won't be fair.

Guys please tell if i am wrong in my understanding as to how nta grades us and if I am not then please ask this to nta.

I would suggest nta just shift the date completely for all the people writing on 2nd

383,delhi,"One of the toppers since childhood, is in depression now. Please read a topper's POV",Mental Health,"Hi, I am 25 years old, working as a software engineer, diagnosed with depression and anxiety along with autoimmune diseases.

I have been a topper since I started going school. I was smart, scoring 90+ was not tough for me. Dheere dheere parents k expectations aur badhti gayi, maine khud pe pressure lena start krdiya. Mujhe aisa lagne laga ki main to bu default smart hun, mere marks kamm aa hi nahi sakte, aane hi nahi chahiye. Iske saath performance anxiety bhi aa gayi ki I have to be perfect in every subject.

I would like to share one incident with you all. I was in 4th standard back then, and mere school mein last year k top 3 bachchon ko trophies milti thi in annual function. Unfortunately, 3rd standard mein I was at the 4th position and obviously no trophies for me. I went in annual function with my parents, no trophy for me, Ghar aake my father said: ""Sharam nahi aayi tumhe , tumhe koi trophy nahi mili"". Oh my god that's still stuck me. Uske baad se consistently I used to be in top 3. That incident is so deep stuck in my heart I can't tell. It still hurts.

I used to try to maintain my perfectionism in everything I do, dance, painting, studies. Everything. 

10th k baad JEE diya. Nahi hua 1st attempt mein. I couldn't accept myself, I used to think, this is not me, I am a topper , I can't be this. Something is wrong with me. I also tried s**cide but end moment pe himmat nahi huyi krne ki. Sab kuch planned tha, but nahi kr paayi.

2nd attempt mein ek teir 2 college mila and I kept thinking myself as a failure. I used to think my marks are my worth. College mein bhi aisi hi anxiety k saath saare exams diye. I used to get anxiety attack before every exam. Everyday. 4 saal mein exhaust ho gayi main. Anyhow maintained 8.5+ GPA and kept thinking I am not this, I deserve 9+ and blah blah...... 

Life k 24 saal isi mein nikaal diye, khud ko failure maanne mein. Recently therapy jaana start Kiya Maine, and now I realise khud ko kitna pareshaan kiya hai maine.

I found biology( basically medical) good, easy and interesting, but I didn't choose medical because of the cons( restricted life, over strain, very long time period and continuous learning and etc) like basically, the life of a doctor doesn't suit me.

I've struggled with low confidence and self-esteem since childhood, mainly because I find it hard to communicate clearly and effectively. Mid-conversation, I often go blank due to anxiety, which makes me talk too fast. I'm not keen on parties or social gatherings, and I struggle with small talk on topics I'm not interested in. My childhood was tough; I was bullied for my feminine walk due to weak muscles and bad posture. 

But I'm working on improving myself. I'm focusing on my posture, doing regular runs, and trying to be more social. However, I still feel awkward in social settings, and my newfound confidence sometimes comes off as arrogance. I'm hanging out with a more active social group, but they don't necessarily respect me. I'm hoping to learn from them, but I also want to reduce my anxiety and connect with people on a deeper level. 

I haven't taken on many responsibilities yet, and I struggle to interact with guys my age, especially in a place like Delhi. I'm about 60% more social now, but I need some tips to further reduce anxiety and navigate social settings in Delhi. Also, I'm looking for activities in Delhi to broaden my conversation topics with friends my age.

430,JEE,Just don't give up because of financial constraints. I have come to help everyone who is in need.,Serious,"Listen JEE kids I know sometimes you don't have any financial backing due to which you give up continuing with your further studies. 
I have something for you. 

I am damn Most of you didn't know about this.
Listen 

We spend a lot of time in finding  out actual ways of earning money or atleast fund our education ourselves.

Have you ever heard of scholarships?

1. Let us tell you: Big companies like Google, Amazon, Reliance etc., MNCs ,charitable foundation they all provide financial support in form of scholarships to students those are good in studies or even average or unprivileged. You need not pay back the scholarship amount in the first place. 

2. Sometimes, they may award you as high as 50 thousands to support your education. Scholarship providers just ask for basic details like your class, year background etc. Generally, scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit and financial condition. It may vary case to case.

3. Many times, scholarship providers have their own dedicated portals through which you can fill up the scholarship application forms online which hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes.

4. Those who don't know, there is a term known as 'Corporate Social Responsibility' Policy under which big companies must have to spend a part of their profit for good causes like education, healthcare, environment etc. It's not that these opportunities are meant only for undergraduate studies. They can vary from nursery to PhD level, hear me out.

I know you all are studious, hardworking, innocent youth.

Tell me why  are you m spending 10s of hours in downloading apps from here and there to earn commissions from referral & bonuses? 
stop wasting time playing colour gambling etc. Stop it right now.

For public awareness for scholarships and more such opportunities, we have just started regularly uploading videos on youtube to spread information about such opportunities which are new and active and most importantly, known to lesser people. And everyone can apply and get selected. 

The yt channel name is AAGE HAMESHA scholarships. Alternatively, check profile of ours. If you're still unable to find, then dm. 

Give this post utmost priority- don't be negligent towards education funding opportunities 

FYI, the real and valid scholarships are only those which have absolutely 0 registration fees.

I just wanted to share this because no one talks about it openly. Being your senior I thought of spreading the message to masses rather than just helping 1 to 2 siblings/cousin. 

Share it to your bestie too and him /her fly high.
    
I have written this wholeheartedly so please share it with your peers if you understand it.

433,delhi,Need some help to tackle my ongoing mental health crisis,Mental Health,"
I'm actually going through one of the worst phases of my life atm. Graduated from IP University with a btech degree in EEE and hoped to move abroad once I finished it. My dreams were shattered by Covid. Also lost my grandpa in 2020 to colon cancer, the person I loved the most in my life since I don't get along with my parents that much. We sleep all in 3 different rooms - mother,father and me and we don't enjoy a healthy family relationship at all. Fast fwd from this phase, after going through a period of crippling mental issues and being unemployed for practically 3 yrs, I've finally got a job in finance where I'm currently making 30k per month. I've consulted atleast 2 doctors to resolve my issue of mental health,my dillusions, my extreme and I do mean extreme masturbation addiction and they've provided me with meds which to a certain degree have helped but my progress has stalled even after meds changing and I'm somewhat dissatisfied with their level of service and professionalism for my condition. I've also tried therapy but didn't really work for me even after going for sessions for atleast 4  months. 

Now, for the current situation, I feel like an unmotivated loser in my life. Most of friends have moved abroad to us,uk or grabbed atleast 12-15 LPA packages in mumbai,bangalore,ncr etc. I do not have the motivation to better myself in life. I know what I have to do. I know I have to study hard since for long I've been thinking about getting an mba abroad since my dreams of MS were already shattered and now it only makes sense to go for mba in a couple of years. I know to build an impressove resume and better myself economically, I have to learn skills and apply for jobs in IB firms but I'm not doing any of it. I'm just wasting my time with no desire to better myself economically or socially. On top of that, I've become extremely dillusional thinking that I'm gonna be a multi billionaire etc etc. My mind is fucked up with no memory retention, extreme insomnia,biploar mood swings and no social confidence to carry a conversation, which is a risk contrast from what I was in my college which was a great public speaker and communicator.

I desperately need the best psychiatric help to bring my life back on track. Whenever I try to search for doctors online, it seems like the reviews are somewhat doctored or premeditated since the first 2 doctors I consulted was through their google ratings but it's been 3 years and I'm not out of this pathetic medical situation at all...


I desperately need the help of you guys to provide me with best psychiatrist that are out there and I know using the term best is childish because whoever treats you the best will be the best for you. However, being objectively best is the psychiatrist that is considered best/greatest by most people that doctor has treated...",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/18b2506/need_some_help_to_tackle_my_ongoing_mental_health/,0

So this is like a rant and I don't know where else to post it. I live in Delhi so i guess might as well post it here. I do have 2 friends and my family. I love my parents, my brother and those 2 friends I have but still every night I start feeling lonely. I go to work everyday. I have friends there as well. I live normally whole day. Talking to people, listening to them, helping them. I'm like very normal whole day but as soon as I get to my bed at night, I start feeling depressed. I mean, it starts in the evening. I just can't help it. I do all the normal things i can. I go to gym if possible, I study, I listen to music, watch movies, go outside for walks or to meet my friends. I call them if I want to. I mean, everything should feel normal but then idk why this feeling?? It's like I wanna love someone and to have someone who loves me. I do everything in life with all my heart, and try to spread love and kindness everywhere but never found someone who loves me. I never had a girlfriend, and ig most of it is due to the fact that I went to boys school and then I'm studying from a open University.

509,delhi,[S] Is there a gathering for sad people in Delhi NCR? ,Mental Health,"I’m tired of feeling alone, even when I’m surrounded by people who seem happy or pretend to be. It’s hard to relate to anyone now. I get that people hold on to things that make them happy, but what do you hold on to when there’s nothing left? Moving forward is tough when the past doesn’t feel like it belongs to you anymore, and being present while thinking about a future that lacks a real connection is really difficult. 

I’ve often felt left out because of my constant moody vibe. It’s not something I put on; it’s just how I am right now. Do sad people need happy friends? Probably, but even though I can be happy for my friends, I’m done making them feel bad for me. I don’t want their pity anymore. I know why I’m sad—unresolved childhood trauma my parents ignored, my struggle with adult ADHD that keeps me from focusing on what matters, or that nagging feeling of not having achieved enough.

I feel like I need to dive into these reasons and figure them out. It’s not that I’m suicidal; I value life and believe I have the potential to do something great. But to move forward, I need to let go of this constant sadness because it’s too much to handle. If you’re feeling sad too and need someone to talk to, feel free to reach out, but please be sincere.",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1gs8n1m/s_is_there_a_gathering_for_sad_people_in_delhi_ncr/,0

Have been stuck in life. Doing chores, things are happening to me but I've not been able to do anything about it. It has always been like this. It's not NEW. 

But it's getting unbearable I just want to put petrol on me or jump from somewhere and end this. 

Overbearing neglective parents. 
Haven't achieved anything in life. 
Not even had a single friend since childhood. 

Always lived in fear not to offend or upset anyone. 
HAVE been very meek, gullible, pushover, people pleaser, obedient, subservient, docile. 
Naturally occurred to me to be very kind & giving in my capacity. Even at the cost of my suffering, I PRIORITISED others wants over my needs. May be it comes from my mother, heredity. 

Also being impatient, confused.

I've been EXTREMELY INDECISIVE about everything, If someone give me 500 rupees to go in the market & eat something while being hungry. I'm most likely unable to buy anything & will return the 500 to that person. 

Just living in my own head. Never had any social life. My family is, idk what to say but it's WEIRD. 

Idk WHY I'm like this. 

I tried to call few suicide helplines but there is not any response from there. 

From 7 years I have neither attended school nor college. Just dragging myself. 

I'm just fucked up. Few years ago when I used to READ that someone has committed suicide. I tell myself, WHY ??? someone do it. Isn't there any  other option left. 

But with this first hand experience, got to know. No, it just gets tough day by day. Unbearable, compulsions to do something so severe that I unable to wake up ever again. 

These VOICES in the head are getting louder & louder, darker & darker. Idk how long I can hold it, will it make any sense to holding on MORE, dragging, pushing. 

When I look at myself, I just think HOW CAN I BE SO LIFELESS, USELESS, WORTHLESS & absolutely STUPID & a fool. Who have no AGENDA just living as a dirty insect on the earth. 

Fuck myself. 

I don't want to be ATTENTION seeker. But I feel that I should ask for HELP. Cause how it's written all over the internet ASK FOR HELP, REACH OUT TO SOMEONE. 
But there is no one. Literally nothing. I can't even talk properly, I stammer a lot from childhood, maybe due to this DEEP ROOTED ""Self Esteem"" issues. 

PS : I'm not native still. I'm making this  not so coherent, inconsistent, not at all well articulated.

I was happy that reports came out normal and Cardiologist also said that everything was normal.


But now when I learnt about that I have anxiety, I am sad that my reports came out normal. Because if I had some medical condition then It would've been TREATABLE and I would have been mentally satisfied that this condition will be treated with medicine or surgery etc.


But it's not the case with anxiety. It is not at all treatable for me. Because I am a very overthinker person. I googled about panic attack and anxiety and it said that ""it's a state of mind"". You have to keep your mind busy and ""don't think about this stuff"". 


But the problem with me is that I am thinking about it more. I am trying to watch a comedy video and engaging my brain with something else but I am still thinking about it. And my body is starting to warm up, heart beating very fast, difficulty breathing. 


I am trying so hard not to think but ""not thinking about it"" but it makes me think about it more. 


And I am still having uncomfortable breathing sometimes....

It's making me so sad. Like when you have a disease you know that it will be treated but it's not with this.",34,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/18ajreq/last_month_i_made_a_post_asking_about_my/,0

561,delhi,Online Mental Health Circle on Grief [This is a free to attend event],Mental Health,"Hi everyone,  
I'm back at hosting another Circle - this time the theme is Grief. We're planning this for 12th Dec, Thursday 7:30 pm so that more folks can join in post work and it does not collide with weekend plans or work.

How it works:

*  We typically start out with some basic group guidelines laying down confidentiality and rules that help us maintain a safe space (no interruptions) 
* We go around the group where everyone gets a chance to share their struggles, thoughts, experience on grief. 

How this helps:

* It gives you a group of strangers to connect to who might have experienced similar situations - making it easier to talk
* It opens you up and enables you to talk about your struggles - breaking mental health taboo

566,delhi,When your Regular Tea guy kills his family and Himself,Mental Health,"This Saturday, I was working when I got a call from close friend informing me about shocking murder of two young kids and lucky survival of their mother, who is still recovering in AIIMS ICU.

According to the police the killer was no other than their own father, who was later found dead on the railway tracks.

The man, the alleged murderer, who killed himself after brutally murdering his own son and daughter and leaving her wife dead (who later survived), was known to me. I saw him almost every day. He ran a popular tea stall in Mayur Vihar phase 1.

To my shock, i had met him on the fateful day. Had tea and asked him how he is doing, and he replied in low voice- I am good.

I knew him for more than ten years. He looked like a gentleman, never had fight with anyone, never misbehaved with anyone. Just busy in his work. Preparing one of the best teas in Mayur Vihar and in the process making decent money.

He recently bought a flat. Conversations with him never suggested he is going through any hardships.

3 Days after the incident, I am still thinking what could have happened with him. How he can he kill his two young children with his own hands. A boy aged 15 and a lovely girl aged 9.

How he can he smother his own wife and later put himself on the railway tracks. His familiar face is haunting me. Silence has gripped the popular tea place. All kinds of theories going around.

 A family is gone, leaving many questions behind.  How to cope up with these violent incidents, when they happen so close to you?",56,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1camo9q/when_your_regular_tea_guy_kills_his_family_and/,0

580,JEE,Reality Check: The One-Shot Illusion & How to Actually Prepare - Bitsat,Serious,"Alright, let’s get straight to the point. It’s been TWO years. You guys have already written JEE Mains 1, and JEE Mains 2 is literally next week. Why the fk is your preparation still not done?

If your syllabus isn’t complete yet, you’re in trouble—but you can still salvage the situation. This is your wake-up call. Stop wasting time overthinking and pull your horses together. Now is the time to go all in.

The Problem with One-Shots

A lot of you are blindly relying on one-shots. Sure, they’re helpful, but let’s get real:
 • If someone studied Calculus for 3-4 months, solved PYQs, and practiced DPPs, how can you compete with them by cramming the same concepts in just a week?
 • Concepts take time to marinate. I studied Calculus two years ago, and I can still solve problems easily because I built a strong foundation.
 • If you’re just watching one-shots without solving problems, you’re not even in the same league as serious competitors.

How to Actually Use One-Shots Effectively

Since time is tight, one-shots are only 30% of the work. The rest 70% is YOU putting in effort. Here’s how to make them work:
 1. Watch the one-shot and make notes (or at least compile important formulas).
 2. Solve 50-70 problems per chapter. The JEE PYQs are enough—no need for extra material.
 3. Do self-study & solve good examples to strengthen your understanding.
 4. Even if you won’t match those who studied a chapter for months, you’ll still be ahead of those who only watched one-shots without solving.

How to Plan the Next 60-70 Days
 1. Take three blank sheets and write:
 • Physics 
 • Chemistry 
 • Maths
 2. List all the chapters for each subject.
 3. Create columns for:
 • Syllabus Completion ✅
 • Revision (This should be longer since you’ll revise multiple times)
 • PYQs Solved ✅
 • Mock Test Performance ✅
 4. Once JEE Mains 2 is over, start executing this plan ASAP.

The Importance of Test Series

If there’s one thing that can expose your weaknesses and prepare you for the actual exam, it’s giving mock tests. Many people avoid test series out of fear, but that’s exactly what stops them from improving. The more you test yourself, the better you perform under pressure.

If you’re looking for a solid BITSAT test series, you can buy from any reliable source. Since I know the founders of phodu Club and MathonGo, they’ve offered some extra discount codes for those who are actually serious about their prep. Just let me know if you need one.

This isn’t about selling anything—it’s just a small gesture from their side for those who will actually use it well.

⸻

Final Words

This is high time. Stop looking for shortcuts and start executing. If you’re serious about getting a good BITSAT score, you need to grind smartly. No excuses. No distractions. Just work.

It is not for you. For people those, if it is your second attempt consider this as a last attempt.

This is a vicious cycle of failure and getting into depression. If you want to get into this cycle always have a PLAN B. Give yourself a timeline and if you fail. 99% of you will fail. Every odd is against you. Reservation, Paper leak, Government, Your relatives. 

Focus on your skills and what is in demand in market. Trust me there is a hell lot of money in today’s date if you have tradesman’s skills like plumbing, electrician carpenter.

My whole life was just school → tuition → home. I even did my graduation through an open university, so I never got to experience college life, friendships, or fun.

A couple of months ago, I finally moved out from my home and shifted to Dehradun under the pretext of coaching/exams. I’ve met a few guys here who are in university, and even though they’re 4-5 years younger than me, I vibe with them like crazy. But the problem is—they have their own lives, best friends, and routines, and I constantly feel like I’m imposing myself on them.

When I’m with them, I feel alive for the first time. But the moment I’m alone in my room, it hits me like a truck. I feel empty, I wait for their texts, hoping they’ll include me in their plans. To distract myself, I’ve been overindulging in unhealthy habits—staying up till 4 AM watching movies, skipping meals, and even fapping twice a day just to relieve stress. But nothing is helping. Every morning, I wake up feeling lonely, and lately, the thought of ending it all has been creeping in.

I don’t want to feel like this. I just want to experience real friendships and a sense of belonging. If anyone has been through this, or if you have advice, please help. I don’t want to spiral further.

So I avoid touching anyone (0 is also an even number), but if I do touch them once, I'll get very restless and in worst case it would show on my face.

I’m 23 years old and really want to pursue MBBS in a government medical college. However, I have a few challenges:  

I completed 12th with PCB but my foundation in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology is weak.  
I have been doing B.Com but now I want to fully focus on NEET preparation.
  
Since I belong to the SC category, I know I have a better chance at getting a seat if I score well.  

My Concerns:

1. How should I start NEET preparation from scratch? (Any good books, online resources, or coaching recommendations?)  

2. How much time will it take to build a strong foundation? (Is 1 year enough?)  
3. What should be my study plan to maximize my score?  (I need to get at least a safe rank for a government MBBS seat in Maharashtra.)  

4. Is it too late to start now at 23?** (Will my age affect anything in admissions or career later?)

5.Any strategies to manage motivation and stress?

I’m fully committed and ready to put in the hard work. Any guidance, personal experiences, or motivation from those who’ve been in a similar situation would mean a lot!

Nothing good has happened in my life. I’m practically a burden at home because I’m unable to get married. I had a failed long-term relationship, and I just can’t accept the idea of an arranged marriage. I get anxiety attacks when my parents talk about shaadi ka rishta.

I basically do not want to exist. My life has no purpose. My parents have a son and a daughter before me, which was enough. And I hate that they brought me into this cruel world.

My best friend’s sister died today. She was separated from her husband and left behind two kids. 

Now their responsibility is on my best friend, who is herself unmarried. She doesn’t have her father, and she is the most wonderful person I have met. She has done so much for her family, and I only wish good for her. Since her sister is gone, I know that the responsibilities for the kids are going to fall on her. The father of the kids is good for nothing.

Now I feel like I have no purpose on this earth. I have no responsibilities and no one dependent on me. It should have been me. I don’t want this life, but she did. She was living for her kids. God is unfair.

Everything is going alright in my life, everything is going good, but something feels off. I am seeing a good girl from my college, my sister and I get along pretty well, friendships are alright too, let's just say that. I don't know what's wrong with me.

When I'm with the girl that I'm seeing, I don't feel a lot for her, like, I know I like her, I know I'm attracted to her, but I can feel less about it. When we have sex, sex is good, but I don't get a lot excited. When we hang out, I feel well, indifferent. I like her, I want to love her, but I can't feel it, it's frustrating and annoying.

When I'm with my sister, I can't be happy, I can't feel that comfort that I used to feel around her, I tend to pretend amd fake it so that she does not get concerned, but it's getting tougher everyday.

I am a pretender, I keep pretending day in and day out, with my father, with the girl that I like, with my sister, idk where I could go, honestly. I'm just wasting my father's money on this useless college degree, and living away in a city like Delhi, which I have no use for. I have recurring thoughts that if I wasn't here, noone would care a lot. They would, for sometime atleast, but everyone moves on with their lives. Noone is hung up on anyone. I realised this thing when my mother passed away last year in March. So if I were to disappear someday, the lives of the people will not change a lot. I feel the need to pass a sharp object through my heart.

It's shameful to think like this, this is not right, but I can't help these thoughts, I keep doubting the people around me, I keep questioning their faithfulness and I keep doubting their love for me.

680,delhi,"[Long Post] I found a home in Delhi, and I may have lost it forever.",Mental Health,">**TL;DR:** Delhi was the only place I felt at home, and now it has been taken away from me. Now I face a choice between starting from scratch in Delhi or going wherever the next best career opportunity takes me. I don't know whether to go back to the peace, comfort, and opportunities I found and have in Delhi, or stepping in uncharted territory and potentially ruin my life, if not several years of it. 

I moved to Delhi in 2017 from Lucknow after I failed to goto the US for my undergrad. Got admissions and all, it's just that my parents didn't have the means despite my scholarship. I clearly remember practically running from my house to go to my uncle's place in Faridabad so I could participate in this hackathon I found out about. Mind you, this was even before my 12th board results had been declared and the hackathon was for college students. 

Showed up in Delhi, went to the hackathon and to everyone's surprise, won it. This continued for other hackathons until I basically just started showing to every college hackathon I found and almost won all of them or placing in the top three. Then, I found an internship that paid well for someone who had just gotten out of school and started working.

At the end of 2017, after dropping a year, I refused to cave into pressure from my family and applied to US colleges again. Got admitted, got a scholarship and still fell short of the money required to go. I clearly remember having a conversation with my father and education counsellor while crossing the intersection at Crown Plaza (near Okhla) and I broke down in the middle of the road. 

Went against everything and somehow got admitted to CS(H) in DU, a decent college too at that (in the south campus though). Worked my ass off to get my first apartment -- a very trashy 1 room in one of those Satya Niketan PGs. At this point, it was 2018 and I hadn't asked a single penny from my father, nor I would going forward. 

Fast forward to my second year, got a better apartment and kept working jobs alongside college. It was difficult to keep up with the south Delhi crowd, but I did my best. Then COVID came and I survived that too. Finally, when college was over, I moved to a proper 1BHK in Saket (Neb Sarai actually) and started building the home 10 year old me would've imagined. 

It took me years of hard work, but by 2023 I had a job that paid enough so that I didn't have to look at my bank account while spending, and I had a house that wowed people when they saw it. I was in a pretty good place in my life looking forward to what came next. 

In June 2023, I finally caved into pressure from my family to pursue my master's and get a 'real' job. Ended up doing a completely different field (despite vowing that I'll never study anything except Computer Science/Engineering). When I was flying away from Delhi to Chennai (where I am as of now), I left my fully decked, gorgeous apartment in my flatmate and school friend's hands hoping that he'd hold on to it until I returned (which should be in the next 1-1.5 months). 

Last December, this 'friend' of mine blindsided me and vacated the apartment. All my belongings, lakhs in terms of tech equipment and countless in terms of sentimental value are now scattered around in Delhi in different people's homes. I visited Delhi in December to move some of my stuff to Lucknow, and boy did it feel so empty coming to the city I called home and not having a house to go to. 

I've never been attached to a city, primarily because growing up my father had a transferring job so I never lived in a city for longer than three years. Faced a lot of issues because of this as I wasn't able to make friends. However, the five years I've lived in Delhi made me a different person altogether. Not only am I far more confident in myself, but I also finally found a city I can call home. 

Delhi threw everything at me -- trouble, hardship, poverty, embarrassment, insecurity, and even sexual harassment (I'm a guy). You name it and there's a good chance I've faced it in Delhi. I fought through all odds and finally earned a place for myself in this city, all by myself, only for all of it to slip underneath my feat. 

My course is coming to an end in the next 1-1.5 months and I have to find a new job and move somewhere. I want to move back to Delhi but that might not be the best move career-wise. I can't live in any other city in this country now (Mumbai, Bangalore, or whatever you name it, it just isn't the same as Delhi). 

Now I'm stuck choosing between returning to Delhi and starting from scratch, or prioritising my career and going wherever the next best opportunity takes me. I don't know if returning to the comfort of Delhi is the best thing to do career-wise because I've got responsibilities I can't run from anymore. On the flip side, I don't know if I'll be able to spend even a month in a different city. ",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1b8oobd/long_post_i_found_a_home_in_delhi_and_i_may_have/,0

684,delhi,What's happening with this modern say if thinking where hatefulness is justified and decency is put to last importance.,,"Saw this opinion on a r/delhi post where PM Modi was giving some hateful remarks.


I get that political talk can be different based on where you are, but let's be real—our leaders need to keep it decent and respectful. It's not just about sounding good; it's about setting a positive tone for everyone.

Look at Barack Obama. His campaign and presidential speeches were all about respect and inclusivity, not just when he was talking to other countries but there in the US too. He always addressed the big issues directly and worked with the opposition and media, giving space for real conversations instead of stirring up drama.

A good leader shouldn't just sweet talk us. They need to tackle the real issues head-on and be willing to have open, respectful discussions with everyone. 

Decency in speech isn't a weakness; it's strength and integrity. It's about leading by example and making sure our political scene is about real ideas and respectful debate",2,2,https://i.redd.it/1kcxlrwgzp2d1.png,0

689,delhi,Feeling Discouraged During My Internship,Mental Health,"Hi everyone,
I’m currently doing an internship at a Kendriya Vidyalaya school, and today my professor came to observe my teaching. My internship is divided into two parts: primary and upper primary. I’ve been working hard for the past four months, especially in the primary section, where I’ve put in so much effort to grow and learn as a teacher.

During her visit, my professor compared me to another student from my college who failed last year. That student only did four days in the primary section, while I’ve been dedicating myself here for months. The comparison just broke me. It made me feel like all my hard work isn’t being recognized, and now I’m questioning whether I even deserve to be here.

I know teaching comes with its challenges, but this situation has left me feeling really low. I’m struggling to remind myself of my value and to not let one moment define me. Has anyone else experienced something like this during their internship or job? How did you deal with it?

716,delhi,Why does me coming from a humble background always ruins things for me?,Mental Health,"I'm sure you're confused reading this but lemme tell you something I faced here in Delhi NCR.

So I recently moved to Delhi NCR, and just like any other person wanted to socialize with peeps around, but sadly no-one ever had those intentions with me, I was aware people around me never considered me as a friend but still ....the thing that shocked me the most was while returning from an event where we all were invited...so we were 8 people had to book 2 cabs right they started booking the cabs initially saying we'll all take 2 cabs nd all...but guess what some people feel so disgusted with the thought of sharing a cab with me that they deliberately only booked UberXL and didn't even let me know till the last moment when the cab was outside the venue and squeezed 7 people in with a grin on their faces, after that only I was left alone to fend for a bike taxi in the middle of night.... I'm sure you know its really difficult to find a bike at odd hours...had me scrambling for quite some time and lastly had to book a cab all for myself 😞. NGL that did leave quite a big hole in my pocket....as it was Delhi to GGN.

Also I've overheard them saying things like I don't own even a bike/car so there's no point in being friends with me nd all ....always giving me side-eyes nd shit....

Another incident that may/maynot be the 13th Reason I wrote this post is this one  ..these guys were planning a trip to Murthal one night...and I was allowed in the plan because one of their friends had denied...so I was looking forward to it...but as night rolled and people that lived close to the carguy got in the guy's car and went to pickup others I was also in the car at this point...and we went to pick one of the guy's gf from her PG and coincidentally the girl's roomate had come down to see her off mind you this was the same person that had cancelled the plan due to which I was asked for the trip....these guys now started pestering and pressuring her to come along....when she raised the point of no seat availability...there was no hesitation in any of them saying that I'd forgo the trip for her's sake as she was originally in the plan....nd I was stunned, felt betrayed and all sorts of emotion....after this had to forgo going on that car ride coz....yk the obvious..

Felt really sad nd depressed....is this all coz they know I'm not from an affluent background..nd won't like spend money like crazy....

I don't know what to do feel trapped with these people around me.....that I hve to see everyday with a fake smile on. Is this the real face of Delhi NCR??",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1jgsnz8/why_does_me_coming_from_a_humble_background/,0

You see, I've always struggled with friendships. Growing up, I never had a solid social circle—just one or two friends, or none at all. Now, I work in the media industry, so I meet a lot of people. I have over 5,000 contacts on my phone, but... none of them are *real* friends. I can start a conversation with anyone for work, but it always feels superficial. I just can’t seem to form lasting connections.

I love spending time by myself—hours in cafes, exploring the internet, being with my thoughts—but I know deep down that something’s missing. For the fulfillment of being human, we need genuine social connections.

I’ve been to therapy a few times, trying to figure it out, but it didn’t seem to help much. And now, here I am, asking for help from people who might understand. Is anyone else in the same boat? Do you ever feel like you're stuck in this cycle of loneliness, even when you're surrounded by people?

Now she's constantly telling and berating me of how everyone else is better, unke pair chaat jaake, relatives ke saamne izzat nahi, they laugh at you. You're just wasting your time not studying, needed an excuse to leave work like a lazy worthless member of society. 

I play games for 2to 2 and half hrs a day, and that's affecting my brain and mental illness, according to my mother, and that's why I can't see beyond their 'love and advice'. Tell me, if a person is subjected to 1-2 hrs of berating lecture, of how useless I am, how I wasted my fathers money (I'm 21,and I've nothing to be happy or to live for), for mornings, afternoons and evenings, is that encouragement or just fuckin mental torture each day? 

Sorry for the rant, but need some genuine advice on how to be alone, and study on my own with as much less cost as possible. If someone could guide me regarding online jobs, or blogging, I'd be extremely grateful as well, so that I can manage my own expenses to some extent.

721,delhi,"I Feel Completely Lost. Stuck in Regret, Isolation, and Overwhelming Thoughts",Mental Health,"**I feel lost, overwhelmed, and stuck in my head. I don’t know what’s happening to me.**

I’m a 22F, and I feel like I’ve completely lost control over my life. I cry for no reason, and my mind just won’t stop. It keeps dragging me back to my past, replaying my mistakes and regrets over and over again.

**How It Started**

I was a JEE aspirant and took a drop year after 12th in 2020, but the lockdown completely threw me off track. I lost momentum, started using my phone excessively, and slept a lot. I was also on medication for migraines, and an overdose caused concentration issues and insomnia. I struggled to study but somehow managed to secure good marks and got into a Tier-2 college.

**Semester 1:** Online classes, family issues, and a strong urge to escape home.

**Semester 2:** Moved to college and got into a relationship with the first guy who showed interest in me. I did not make friends or network, just spent my time with him. I didn’t join any society because of migraine.

**Semester 3:** He cheated on me, and I was devastated. At the same time, my roommate lost her brother to suicide and left for home. I barely attended classes and spent most of my time in my room.

**Semester 4:** I got into fashion and photography, started posting normal as well as bold pictures on Instagram, and made a friend who shared the same interests. But things took a horrible turn—my batchmates started calling me ""characterless"" because of my posts and my past relationship. Online bullying became unbearable. I was defamed in my college and even in other colleges. I stopped attending classes, spent entire days in bed, and ultimately deleted my Instagram account.

During semester break, I went home, but the environment was unhealthy. My mental health kept deteriorating.

**Semester 5:** I started attending classes again but sat alone. No one would sit with me or talk to me. I created another anonymous Instagram account just to watch reels and escape my loneliness. My old roommate returned, which helped a little, but I still felt isolated.

I started coding in semester break. I know I started very late.

**Semester 6:** I focused on academics and started preparing for placements. I got used to being alone—attending classes, eating in the mess, and even going to the doctor alone. But I didn’t realize that I was isolating myself too much. When I changed rooms, my new roommate avoided me because of the past bullying. My old roommate also distanced herself. Feeling even more lonely, I installed dating apps, but they only made things worse.

**Semester 7:** Placement season started, but I didn’t apply. I wasn’t prepared, yet I wasn’t preparing either—I just slept and avoided everything. I also started experiencing severe neck and hand pain, which was later diagnosed as cervical issues.

**Semester 8:** I moved into a single rented room and opted for NPTEL courses instead of regular classes. My health worsened, and I kept visiting different doctors. One prescribed me an antidepressant that caused severe insomnia, and things went downhill from there. I couldn’t study, couldn’t even finish a single NPTEL lecture, and even basic things like multiplying numbers felt impossible.

 

I feel like I’ve wasted my college years. The word **“friend”** haunts me. I’m scared of studying, scared of talking to people because of the bullying. I have no interest in my hobbies anymore. Movies don’t excite me. I feel completely overwhelmed.

For the past four years, all I did was **eat, sleep, and scroll through reels.** I never helped my mom at home. Now, I feel like I’ve become useless. I told my family everything, but they won’t allow me to go to therapy.

Lack of exercise has **deteriorated my physical health**, and reels have **emptied my brain.** I feel like I have no knowledge of anything—politics, coding, history, current affairs, science, sports—nothing. I wasted time in college, and now I feel like I know absolutely nothing.

I can’t sleep, no matter how tired I am. My mind won’t shut up—it keeps attacking me with thoughts. I’ve lost so much weight. There’s this voice in my head telling me that I’ve gone mad, that I should be admitted to a mental asylum, or that I should just run away from home.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I just want this feeling to stop. I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t know if anyone will read this, but if you’ve been through something similar or have any advice, please share. I feel like I’m at a breaking point, and I don’t know how to pull myself out of this.",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1jhwkeg/i_feel_completely_lost_stuck_in_regret_isolation/,0

It was already pretty bad and then I fell in love with this girl. She cheated on me. After that for almost 3-4 years i was very depressed. I used to get anxiety attacks. I still do but not as bad. For the past one month I am again feeling the same way.
I want to kill myself but I love my mom and my sister so much that I can’t even take my life. Please help me. I know I need therapy but I can’t afford to.

But the problem is, the more I learn about money  and India in general, the more pissed or rather hopeless I feel... 

I do not come from a strong financial background because my father is a gambling addict and he have destroyed all the wealth he had(even our only house is gone)... 

I am a keen observer of stock market and that makes me read the financial statements of the company... And man let me tell you, the amount of money that government collects by *taxes* is something every Indian should know about... 


The more I learn about taxes, the more hopeless and ripped of I feel...I can confidently say that after every 5-6 time circulation of money it ultimately gets back to the government in the form of either taxes or fines etc... But the problem is I don't know where it's all going... I am starting to hate the Indian government and the fact that non tax payers are the ruling government deciders pisses me off more... 

Recently I saw Infosys founder *Mr. Narayan Murthy said that Indian should work 70-90 hours a week to build and country and all that bullshit but the fact that his own children are living in London* is showing the Hypocrisy of one of the larger Indian businessman... 


Moreover the sad part is the people who are representing us in the parliament, even the oppositions, don't trust the system of the country... Raghav Chadda went abroad to have a minor surgery which does happens in India as well... The son and daughters of politicians go to abroad and settle there... And we are here left to die in the gas chamber where we ain't even allowed to drive the vehicle we own cause apparently vehicals are causing pollution.. 


I have decided to work my ass off and leave the country as soon as possible... I am Targeting by the age of 27 I must leave because I can't raise a family in this society... I can do whatever it takes to leave this country not because I don't love my country, but because government is ruining it...

I am feeling extremely overwhelmed with the amount of work that is their at my end. It's been a hectic week and this weekend too seems like will be spend hunching on my system. My life has turned around a lot in last one year or so, and not in a nice way. I was sort of content with my role at work for almost 5 years, even though it didn't provide too much of a growth due to the overall work-life balance. Now suddenly I am part of a project and a team where I literally need to be on my toes 24/7, and frankly I feel that I am not capable of handling so much of stress. May be staying in a comfort zone for years has taken away my capability to upskill and handle a much more dynamic environment. Moreover, I feel as if my overall emotional and mental health is literally going to dogs. I can't take a break from the work because I have tons of dependencies. While my wife understands what I am going through, but I don't want to burden her too much. It's not that I have not tried to apply to other places, but I am being rejected left and right.

Our newly bought July 2023 Tata Safari Red Dark edition (DL10CW2155) got stolen from our home parking in Delhi this morning. The thief broke the drivers window and took the car within minutes. When we check the CCTV footage, they came in White Creta with tools and gears.

I got the immobilization event 2-3 hours after my car was gone from our house. We tried all what we could do from the iRA app, but nothing worked. We called Tata customer care, but they also couldn't track the car. I'm so angry and disheartened that I spent a ton of my savings to buy the car and it got stolen in minutes. TATA iRA didn't work. What all was advertised while buying the car got shattered in minutes.

Last location it showed was in Azadpur, Delhi. We went to the location, searched like anything, but we couldn't find anything. We raised the FIR then and informed the insurance company after the incident. I read the news recently that one car gets stolen in Delhi every 14 mins. I feel so unsafe right now that I question what all we pay so hefty tax for. No safety and no responsibility from public departments. Our hard earned money just got wasted for nothing.

I have lost the hope in finding my car, but if anyone finds or see any trace of car, please DM.

Chassis Number: \*\*\*631047P\*\*\*\*804

Note: I would be really thankful, if any leads/help/references that any one of you have that could lead me to find the car.",10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1cn416h/tata_safari_red_dark_edition_stolen_from_delhi/,0

It got me over thinking. 

At work they call me a strong independent woman, many men prefer a woman with no baggage like that.
But the deal with an independent woman is that they have learnt to not express it or ask for it which makes people believe that they don't want it. Make them believe that oh she is so not needy not demanding.

Perhaps that's why dealing with life and relationship doesn't come so hard for them for there are barely any practical expectations.

( please read it completely I will try adding emoji to make it less boring 🙏 🤲 

F 19, these people really bullied me and teachers too. I was so awkward and dumb in the past idk what to do now. I was 15 back then. They are connecting with me on snap and insta. Idk what to do...really I feel like crying and most of these guys don't even remember me. They talking me through just my name. Bs ye h ki ladki se baat kr ra hu m . And most of them just straight up acting friendly like stop the bs you all ruined my whole school life and best years of my life. They bullied me so bad and then asked me why I don't talk to them? Why am I so quiet?

This guy would call me behen in everyline coz our school was conservative abt girls and boys being friends. He would say coz I was really ugly and I don't misunderstand that I like him. Most boys won't even consider talking to girls who are hot pretty. So I was a loner and had no friends.  Girls would just look down on me. Constantly saying I'm weird. I was so insecure at 15 that I let them say whatever they want. I once gave my no. To this girl that she can call me 🤙 if she need help and she threw my no. But it was ok as I was desperate to just get one friend. 

So desperate . Every new school year I would seat alone. 💺 I would cry and pray to God for just one friend and if it was too much to ask. I remember another incident.

My teacher made me sit with this popular guy and he said no I'm not sitting with her infront of whole class. He and my teacher argued for 15 min and in the end he sat with me and in free period he would ask me to exchange seat like am I eating u bro?? Worst year of my school life,

It was so embarrassing for me. Maybe coz other girls in my class were more pretty. Uske baad 5 saal Hoge kabhi kisi ladke ko approach nhi kiya drr lgta h.

I'm more confident now thank to God and more mature just anyone going through it . U r ok ur not ugly ur not dumb. Ur just surrounded by wrong people 😕 and it's gonna be ok just keep fighting. ❤️ ",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1coqx9q/my_past_bullies_are_trying_to_reach_out_to_me/,0

Most of us have enough time to sit and watch cartoons but none of us try to find out actual ways of earning money or atleast fund our education ourselves.

Each one of us have students around us. Either in the form of a son or daughter or friend or relatives, in case  you think that it's not a right community to post.


Have you ever heard of scholarships?

1. Let us tell you: Big companies like Google, Reliance, etc., MNCs ,charitable foundation they all provide financial support in form of scholarships to students those are good in studies or even average or unprivileged. You need not pay back the scholarship amount in the first place. 

2. Sometimes, they may award you as high as 50 thousands to support your education. Scholarship providers just ask for basic details like your class, year background etc. Generally, scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit and financial condition. It may vary case to case.

3. Many times, scholarship providers have their own dedicated portals through which you can fill up the scholarship application forms online which hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes.

4. Those who don't know, there is a term known as 'Corporate Social Responsibility' Policy under which big companies must have to spend a part of their profit for good causes like education, healthcare, environment etc.

5. It's not that these opportunities are meant only for undergraduate studies. They can vary from nursery to PhD level, hear me out.

Are you really happy spending 10s of hours in downloading apps from here and there to earn commissions from referral & bonuses? Please stop wasting time playing colour gambling etc.

We have just started regularly uploading videos on youtube to spread information about such opportunities which are new and active and most importantly, known to lesser people.

The yt channel name is AAGE HAMESHA scholarships. Alternatively, check profile of ours. If you're still unable to find, then dm. 

It is always better to fill up 1 scholarship application form instead of filling 100s of unpaid internship forms. Many curious/meritorious/ unprivileged and active students apply for these wonderful opportunities and get selected with ease and make their parents proud of themselves. 

Give this post utmost priority- don't be negligent towards education.

Imagine there is an unprivileged student who is at the verge of dropping off the class or college because of insufficient funds for education. Alll of you who have accounts over here may post this in 1-2 most active student communities and your Whatsapp groups for public awareness. Believe us, it will spread like fire. Consequently, deserving and needy students will be get benefitted. 

Remember that the real and valid scholarships are only those which have absolutely 0 registration fees.

I just wanted to share this because no one talks about it openly.

867,delhi,Shitty College Experience. (rant),Mental Health,"I study in a Law college in NCR affiliated to a university in Delhi.  Obviously we see people from a variety of places here and i strongly support intermixing and diversity among Indians throughout. 

However in my college there is a particular group of people, most members of which belong to 2 certain castes.   
I wont say the name of the castes here because it would result in comment wars, but I will reveal that they belong to the 2 famous peasant and landowning castes in and around NCR. 

The reason I mentioned this is because they themselves actively tell others about this. EVERY SINGLE DAY.   
  
I will give you a perspective-   
You reach the college with your two wheeler, you see a few SUVs parked directly in front of the gate, blocking it almost.   
You see big stickers mentioning the name of the castes. You cannot ask them to park somewhere else so that you can put your 2 wheeler in the college parking (which is inside, yes it is spacious enough for 2 wheelers not cars).

Anyhow you ignore them and wait for them to clear the path (which may take any amounts of time) or you dismount and somehow take your vehicle inside and park it.  
  
You then decide to go to your class. On the way you see the way of the stairs being blocked by the people who belong to the aforementioned group. They are usually talking about inter-caste fights or some famous guy of their caste committing some public nuisance. You ignore their talks but you cannot ask them to clear some path, else they will initiate something. 

You still manage to move through and climb up the stairs to your class. 

You take your classes and voila! you get a tea break. 

You leave your class and in the corridor see a poor guy being beaten up but the usual suspects. But what can you do? You go and drink your coffee. 

Well after that, 2 more classes and you get a bigger lunch break. Guess what you decided to eat your lunch in peace in your class. But suddenly you see 2-3 guys of the group barge in. They have with them a marshall speaker. And obviously they start playing loud music, containing casteist wordings. 

You can do nothing but ignore. 

Break's over guys, next up you see the final 2 lectures have been suspended, now you have a guest lecture.   
So you reach the seminar hall, and being an introvert loner, you sit at the last seat. 10 mins pass, you see the bully gang and they see you too. 

Buddy you are in big trouble, to get out of which you need to do a trade. 

""Chutiye seat se uth jaa, humein baithna bhai."" you are met with a warning. 

You have 2 options-   
1. you move (suppressing your anger)   
2. you say no (you are feeling zesty today) 

You already know what is happening right? Either you go home without a scratch or you go to the hospital. 

Naturally being a pragmatic guy, I would ignore these guys and say nothing or move away. This is how I survived 3 years with no damage.

But it feels so helpless sometimes. 

I am no god, I too lose patience. But with these guys, you cannot answer back even once. It's like they want you to reply/show your inconvenience.

883,delhi,Why drugs are banned?,Mental Health,"Why this selective morality?Why Some Vices Are Permitted While Others Are Criminalized

Governments claim to protect society by banning harmful substances like drugs, but at the same time, they allow alcohol, tobacco, and pornography—things that also destroy lives. If the concern is public health, then why not ban everything harmful? And if the excuse is tax revenue, then why not legalize and tax all vices?

Alcohol contributes to violence, drunk driving deaths, and addiction. Tobacco causes cancer and strains healthcare systems. Pornography has links to mental health issues and social isolation. But these are all legal because they’re socially accepted and profitable. Meanwhile, drugs remain illegal—not because they’re more dangerous, but because the government hasn’t figured out how to tax and regulate them without backlash.

So, where do we draw the line? Should all harmful things be banned for consistency, or should governments just admit that regulation is about control and money, not morality?",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1jlzykc/why_drugs_are_banned/,0

1) How is Allen Patna overall? Do you think it is not on the same level as Allen Kota, especially considering the ₹1,70,000 fee, which is the same for both centers (I’m not going to Kota, though)?

2) How are the teachers? How many years of experience do they have? Do they have solid knowledge of the 12th board syllabus, JEE Mains, and JEE Advanced? Can they effectively address doubts and guide you on which chapters are crucial for both boards and JEE exams?

3) Do they teach at a reasonable pace? For example, do they cover 11th-grade topics while you're in 12th, leaving some 12th topics uncovered and resulting in incomplete syllabus coverage during class?

4) Do they teach with respect to the 12th board pattern once you’re in class 12th? For instance, in PCM, we need to write all the steps in the board exams, so are the tests designed to reflect that format?

5) How are the classes structured? How many hours are dedicated to each subject (PCM), and how many days a week are the classes held? Also, how are the tests scheduled?

6) How is the doubt-solving system? Do they clarify doubts for all students during class, or are some left unanswered with vague explanations? Do they provide doubt support after classes, and are they willing to help outside class in a constructive way?

7) How are the offline tests at the center? What is their duration, and is the format objective or subjective? How do the papers compare to the level of JEE Mains and JEE Advanced? Also, how is batch shuffling handled based on test performance?

8) Is the study material up to the required level?",4,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEE/comments/1jnypnw/allen_patna_for_jee/,0

892,delhi,Fine line between fiction and my reality,Mental Health,"There's no sense in writing this. Good people die early, 'they must be okay', 'they definitely are better' and the worst isn't a nightmare but rather a common human affection, no one actually cares. Sometimes the person distributing their soul, time, energy and resources just keeps on giving, it for me symbolises a mother but I know that is far fetched it leaves them hollow within, which lets be honest no one bothers looking into. The pain a mother goes through is insurmountable and these kindred souls understand that well and set on a journey to help people experience the same love, unconditional love. Unconditional love is as the name suggests an epitome of humanity, it isn't just limited to humans but also to nature and animals as well. It gives them joy and a sense of purpose, it feels like healing the world as a whole itself while bringing diversity together in is their subordinate objective. They prefer to carry out their holy duties and leave silently and peacefully as they wouldn't want to bother the recipient with even a slightest bit of obligation of any sort. Unfortunately these endeavours can be held culpable for diminishing the light, withering of the tree as a storm rises in their hearts. It's highly likely that it is the time where their roots need to be strengthened and the fire needs to be protected from the storm. The storm is terrifying, raging through the plains towards the mountain of hope where the soul seeked shelter. Clinching on to hope, only light in now what seems to be embers and an uprooted tree.
Hope is a curse that we bestow upon ourselves gracefully. As he rests his back on the tree-trunk and does his best to motivate himself, trying to remember his mistakes, his curses, his blessings and his blunders. He wonders whether he was able to contemplate for all of it, a familiar resounding voice echoes within 'No'. The mountain crumbled under the ferocious storm into mere pebbles, hope was always fragile for him. The hunger for love and comfort dared to forego his mental restrictions as he broke down the barriers in his heart, some made by him while the rest of it was a gift from others. Regardless, a pitch black cloud seeps out of his heart in response to the distraught outside, to meet it's kin perhaps. Frightening as it may be, he knew what he sees is what's within. It was a part of himself, he couldn't let the only part of his soul left to be homeless.
His thoughts changed to gratefulness and gratitude for everyone who had came into his life, good or bad they all taught him a lesson and it was cumulative that he is who he is. Respecting your enemies may result to certain death in war but in this modern world it is a key to making more friends, a happier world. That was his dream. Initially it felt like dozen of syringes pierced in his body which kept on growing. He left a deep sigh and let all of darkness out and was flooded in it. The storm resulted in a flood and he lay there resting on the trunk as he re-lived all his memories especially those where he thought he made a mistake. He wanted to make sure that he suffers and punish himself as he can no longer carry out his duty of spreading love. What irony! Faint rays of light fell upon him, he looked like a inebriated fellow with dry drool around his face. Four months had passed, the near was end. He didn't have the strength to punish himself any longer, the darkness and himself which sustained each other was fading away slowly. He felt relieved, maybe someone finally decided to forgive him for his sins. The curse was lifting and so was his life. He had no hope but to drown in the water below and to be left undisturbed forever, he had enough of this mortal world.
He wanted to be selfish for one last time as he dipped his feet into the water and then his entire self. His death was painful, he assumed he deserved it. Months of deprivation and surrounded by something which he can never escape he left his last breath away from receiving love or sharing his pain.",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/18nl5de/fine_line_between_fiction_and_my_reality/,0

941,JEE,Need Advice: Feeling Demotivated After JEE Test Results,Serious,"
Hey everyone,

I just completed my 11th class, and my college has started the 12th class JEE portion. Currently, we’re doing modern physics in physics, theory of equations in maths (to strengthen other chapters), and d-block & f-block in chemistry.

I studied consistently last week(For the weekly mains examination conducted by the college in the completed portion), putting in 7-9 hours daily (excluding my 5-hour college schedule). Despite all that effort, I only scored 111 marks and ranked 7th in my test. I was expecting at least 150+, and now I’m feeling really low. I can’t talk about this with my friends or teachers, and I feel like the management might be disappointed in me or even taunt me about my score.

I’m giving my best, but I still fell short. If anyone has been in a similar situation, I’d love to hear your advice. How can I improve my study strategy and performance?

Thanks in advance.

In Delhi, I can drive, get tattoos and receive constructive feedback about them, and I can cook.

Why do people never talk about the part of depression when you just don't want anything anymore? Everybody talks about when it hurts like hell, when you cry, when you cut, when you take drugs, when you break down. But no one ever talks about when you just lay down in your room, with a hole inside of you that you don't know how to fill, and you don't want to do anything even the things you usually like. So you just spend your day kinda waiting for it to end. And it's horrible because you feel empty and guilty for that at the same time

Why anyone didn't know about this? 
Listen listen
Most of us have enough time to sit and watch cartoons but none of us try to find out actual ways of earning money or atleast fund our education ourselves.

Have you ever heard of scholarships?

1. Let us tell you: Big companies like Google, Amazon, Mercedes Benz, etc., MNCs ,charitable foundation they all provide financial support in form of scholarships to students those are good in studies or even average or unprivileged. You need not pay back the scholarship amount in the first place. 

2. Sometimes, they may award you as high as 50 thousands to support your education. Scholarship providers just ask for basic details like your class, year background etc. Generally, scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit and financial condition. It may vary case to case.

3. Many times, scholarship providers have their own dedicated portals through which you can fill up the scholarship application forms online which hardly takes 5 to 10 minutes.

4. Those who don't know, there is a term known as 'Corporate Social Responsibility' Policy under which big companies must have to spend a part of their profit for good causes like education, healthcare, environment etc. It's not that these opportunities are meant only for undergraduate studies. They can vary from nursery to PhD level, hear me out.

Tell m, are you really happy spending 10s of hours in downloading apps from here and there to earn commissions from referral & bonuses? If you answer is No.
Then, please stop wasting time playing colour gambling etc.

For public awarenessfor scholarships,
We have just started regularly uploading videos on youtube to spread information about such opportunities which are new and active and most importantly, known to lesser people. And everyone can apply and get selected. 

The yt channel name is AAGE HAMESHA scholarships. Alternatively, check profile of ours. If you're still unable to find, then dm. 

Give this post utmost priority- don't be negligent towards education.

(Upvote if it is helpful)


Remember that the real and valid scholarships are only those which have absolutely 0 registration fees.

I just wanted to share this because no one talks about it openly.

Share it to your bestie too and him /her fly high.

I was having anxiety almost everyday. I thought if I start working, it should be okay.

But it isn’t. I still have anxiety. Now I get irritated and annoyed of myself if I start feeling anxious again and again. I don’t have the finances to seek therapy or professional help as of now.

I am 17 year old preparing for my neet exam with school . I don't know why even if I work hard from my side but I don't get anything in return for it . Even I work hard , even i study , even I have sacrificed things for the sake of studies and everything yet I don't get result . Even I feel ashamed about telling my mock exam results to anyone, even tho i made a progress by 100+ marks . But I got ignored by my tuition teacher for this . I don't know why such things happen with me . In my school , my teacher ignores me no one ever in my life encouraged me to do anything. I was fond of doing art my parents told me to fuck off and study . I was fond of learning japnese I did it on my own i learned alphabets and everything again was told fuck this shit off by my parents for the sake of studies . My parents never ever listen to my ideas and my thoughts. My parents made my life miserable just because of got a gift from a online friend even I gave him gifts on my own without using there money . I have no real friends in real life I am just third wheel in every friendship and maybe the most ignored person in my group . No body wants to listen me . I know nobody gonna read this too . People around me are going to Japan for competitions , people are being appreciated for things they do and here it's me who is doing nothing . Ik my future is dark i always pray to god to make it better he never listens to it . Now I pray to god everytime that he kills me cause I don't have any confidence of doind su*ide , still he isn't listening to me . I am just here to waste my father's money and will rot in my city 🤩while people of my age succeed and enjoy their cool life when they will get old .

1032,JEE,I don't know what is gonna happen overmorrow,Serious,"I come from a family in a town near Bhopal who doesn't understand the difference between ITI and IIT. But are extremely strict about school achievements! So much so that my father a few months ago told me that I have never made him proud and only way I could is getting my photo on the school banner as a topper and afterwards he doesn't care what I do. (This is also my father's I'd).

I didn't buy any batch in 12th as I realised JEE was way out of my league in 11th only. I lost all of my will to study after 10th result when I got beaten by my parents after scoring 92% in CBSE because I gave my all there and if I was still getting beaten then what's the point to study if my family can't appreciate my best try!? 

I just started studying when I wanted with no consistency. Most of the times I just pretended to study in front of parents but my mind wasn't there This way I got around 80% in 11th. This year's board I am predicting for around 90%. 

But the problem is JEE. I thought I had a great 1st attempt in Jan but after coming back I realised I misread a lot of questions and answered questions on wrong options! I don't know how that happened, probably due to pressure and tension. I got around 66%ile. Even a classmate of mine who usually fails in school exams got a better score than me. This just broke me and I haven't studied. Whenever I tried I just couldn't focus. Plus my family is another big problem. They have been pressuring me to go to my aunt's city and join a college there(Saugor, MP). I know if I go there I'll just lose myself totally.

I don't know what's gonna happen in 2nd attempt. I am consistently for some reason getting 35 marks in all the tests I give(3).

I don't want any great college just enough to go away from the family and a nice package, enough to prove myself in front of them and satisfy my needs(more than 5 LPA)

Any suggestions or opinions. Please share.

Nobody has ever talked about there feelings in this house and all the talks are just full of jokes and sarcasm or criticism.
And due to this reason Often times fight or conflict happens ugly words are said feelings are hurt and if it's between us siblings we hit each other. But after sometime everyone just bounce back and the conflict is never bought up again. For example if my brother hits me or annoy me i will hit him back and when it gets ugly the adult will just tell us to keep quite No apologies no punishment and after sometime of anger we will again start chatting.

But the problem is that all this fights and conflict have been getting worse day by day and i can see everyone just bottling uo thier feelings and distancing themselves from each other. My older brother doesn't talk to us anymore my two older sisters has stopped talking to each other years ago over some silly fight. The relationship between me and my younger brother is getting worse and i don't feel like talking to him anymore. And now it's starting between my mom and one of my older sister.

She hasn't talked to mom and eaten properly in 3 days although it's most likely because she is trying hard to loose weight. My mom isn't going to talk to her because apparently she believes that being fed up is okay for 1 or 2 days but u should just get over with it after sometime. I have gotten quit used to it but still i know how it feels. Nothing ever heals all the bottled up feeling come out at some point and u overreact. Sometimes i even cry remembering all those fights but never bring it up.

I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but most people in Delhi are loud enough to make themselves pretty audible.

She was desperate to land a job and was getting restless as she had been sitting at home for a few months.

""For freelancing, you need a good network, and I am not very good at it"", she said further.

At this point, I felt like I had been through this exact conversation!

I have been on the other side as the casual guy advising her on 'sab thik ho jaega yar, chill kar' as well.

- You might not be in the best company in your industry, but work on your little boutique that you always wanted to open.

1059,delhi,"I moved out of my parents house, and my mental health improved ",Mental Health,"Posting this here cause for some reason I’m shadow banned from r/India. 

This is rather a very random post I’m making, cause I was having these thoughts and didn’t know where else to share it. I see a lot people posting about issues with their parents on this subReddit so I thought I might share my 2 cents if anyone cares. 

I am by no means trying to say that my parents are bad people. In fact, they had done everything in their power to move our family from lower middle class status to at least upper middle class. They love me a lot, maybe a little too much, and that’s why I had to put my foot down and decide to move out. Being an only child, this love can be suffocating at times. Your parents might not even realize that what they perceive as an act of love can feel like a chokehold around your neck. I always felt that my parents were overdoing everything—protecting me too much, controlling my daily life too much, caring too much. I almost started despising my own parents and thought that their outlook on life was irredeemable. The thought that I could never grow out of the shell they had created around me was ruining everything for me.
 But it was only after I moved out for good that I realized our parents don’t know any better themselves. They have only known this life; they have never lived for themselves and have always perceived right or wrong from the perspective of those whose influence matters most in their lives. I realized that no matter how much we try to distance ourselves from their love, once we have the mental space and capacity to think from their perspective, we realize that once we are gone, they have nothing else to achieve in their lives, no one else to live for—and that realization hits you only when you are away from them. 
That being said, I believe every person should experience this at least once in their life: being away from home, with no actual experience to handle the unknown. That growth is not only important for mental health but might also help heal the broken relationship with our parents, which initially made us distant from them.

So maybe if you recently had argument with your parents, or haven’t spoken to them in a long time, just maybe give them a call today or try to tell them that you appreciate their efforts. Maybe not for them, but for yourself. 

Thanks for reading through if you made it till here✌🏻",37,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1dkdvax/i_moved_out_of_my_parents_house_and_my_mental/,0

1072,JEE,How Online coachings are destroying JEE preprations...,Serious,"I was the topper in my class 10th who even managed to score 95%age in my Boards, while preparing for my boards I had a simple dream, to be an Airforce officer, But my parents convinced me to prepare for IIT-JEE. I thought that I need good guidance so I joined an online coaching, which later became my worst mistake. In class 10th I used to go in an offline coaching but in my 11th I thought that an online coaching can save my travelling time. I am of general cast BTW. In the start my coaching teachers were all IITians which made me confident for my selection but slowly they all were replaced my Non-IITian teachers now not even a single teacher teaching us is IITian... 
I have now realised that I actually joined an Online scam and not a coaching😭, the fees of the coaching was too high as they promised IITian teachers and good mentorship, they took fees of both 11th and 12th convincing me for my selection. Only I know how my parents afforded the fees. Now I am in class 12th [2025-26 session] but I am not confident anymore. I scored very low percentage in 11th and all my confidence is shattered... 
I don't think I can crack JEE but I atleast want to get good percentage in my class 12th, but all this while I also prepared for NDA which is giving me some hopes.
Many online coaching lovers might disagree with me but they all will soon discover true intentions of their online coachings. 
If anyone is actually looking for any coaching which can help them crack any exam, I highly recommend them offline coachings, even if they are local. 
I don't think I can mention any names... 
Cut to the story--- I have ruined my 11th and want to join an offline coaching for class 12th Physics as I am able to study chemistry and mathematics by myself. Recently a local coaching in my city conducted a free JEE-Mains test series in which I only attempted Mathematics and Chemistry and scored 128, 150 and 188 in all 3 tests [I also attemted Basic physics questions but most of the physics questions were too hard for me].
Now I am convinced that I can crack JEE but I need good guidance for Physics. 
But how will I convince my parents??? 
Can they even afford it??? 
I have started to skip several coaching classes and now my mentors are calling me multiple times asking for my reason to skip these classes... 
Can someone suggest me how can I convence my parents for offline coaching PLEASE???

1077,delhi,How to deal with anxiety attack ,Mental Health,"My ex keeps messaging me repeatedly, which causes me to have anxiety attacks.am I emotionally weak ? (F-27) 

I don't know where to start, but I'm feeling restless after my breakup, which happened 2 years ago. I had posted earlier that my ex would message and call me every 4-5 months, causing me anxiety attacks and affecting my health. I had blocked him, but he kept messaging me, and yesterday I unblocked him and told him to stop bothering me.
Seeing his messages gives me anxiety, and my health deteriorates. I feel like I'm stuck in a loop, reliving the same situation over and over. We don't have a future together, we're not compatible, I don't trust him, and our moral values don't align. He doesn't even listen to me properly and says I'm overreacting.

He says What's wrong with messaging you? I'm not sending you dirty messages. It makes me happy to message you.i  told him, I don't want to talk to you  you're my past, and I don't want to remember it. But he wouldn't listen and said, You can't handle your anxiety ( bs medicine leti rahti hu khud ke dimag ko shant karna nhi aata tumhe ,ek do message karne se kuch nhi hota hai . Tum bas zidhi ho apni zidh ke karan message ka reply nhi deti . Bla bla )

 I explained to him that anxiety and anxiety attacks are different things like anxiety hona normal hai pr anxiety attack me insan suicidal nhi hojata hai , but he didn't understand.

I got frustrated and blocked him again. Last night, I couldn't sleep at all, and my mind was racing. This morning, I had an anxiety attack, and I felt like I was going to collapse. I couldn't breathe properly, and my heart was racing. I felt like I had no strength in my legs, and I vomited.

I'm still feeling restless and anxious. I don't know why I'm posting this, but sometimes I wonder how one person's message can affect me so much. How can someone be so weak that they can't handle anxiety attacks?

If anyone out there can relate, I see you. Because now, with exactly 40 days left for NEET UG, reality has punched me in the face. Feels impossible, right? Yeah, I thought so too. But I’ve decided—I WILL do it.

I’ve always been considered the one with “potential.” The topper. The smart one. But this year? A brutal reality check. Two years of neglect, zero social life, and still somehow managed to not study. The worst part? I just threw away my Class 12 boards. My parents have lost all trust in me. They expect nothing.

But this? This is my do-or-die moment.

Problem? I have zero study habits now. Can’t focus. Can’t sit still. Feels like I’ve developed ADHD or something. And I know for a fact—I cannot do this alone.

So if you’re in the exact same sinking boat, and need someone to grind this out with, let’s connect. We either ace NEET together or die trying.

Itna pressure hai ki saans lena bhi mushkil lagta hai. Dil karta hai sab chhod du, bhaag jaun kahin. Bas ek din sab khatam ho jaye toh accha ho. Zindagi se thak gaya hoon, kuch samajh nahi aata.
