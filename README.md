# 🧠 Hinglish Suicidal Ideation Detection

This project detects **suicidal ideation** in Hinglish (Hindi-English mixed) social media posts using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. It preprocesses informal, code-mixed text by expanding slang, removing stopwords, and normalizing content, then extracts features with TF-IDF and n-grams. Classification models like **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** and **XGBoost** are trained to predict suicidal intent, and **LIME** is integrated to explain which words influence each prediction. An interactive **Streamlit** web app lets users input Hinglish text, see the risk prediction, and understand it through a feature importance visualization. The goal is to support early mental health intervention by identifying signs of suicidal ideation in online language.
